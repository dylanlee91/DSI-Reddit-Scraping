###For you new runners, please check out the info that is in the Wiki.

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq#wiki_for_beginners) the section in the Wiki for beginners (which can also apply to returning runners).  [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/index/common_questions#wiki_i.2019ve_never_run_before.2C_what_do_i_do.3F) also has some good tips.

[This resource](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3TYR3d9S1s1dFpwa3E4NmZfOW8/view) is linked in the sidebar/top menu and may have some info you can use as you get started (or back into) running.

Take some time to the search the sub and browse the daily Official Q&amp;A thread and you will find plenty of tips for getting started/back.

###**Using r/running**

The mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*

The mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.*

Regardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.*

_____

###**Rules**

**(1)** - *Follow proper Reddiquette [Keep it civil!] and the subreddit's Posting Procedures [post flair, using Daily/Weekly Threads].  The moderation team reserves the right to remove content or restrict user posting privileges as necessary.*

We are all here to learn and discuss running.  And with the wide variety of run types, training plans, methods, etc., there will be varying opinions.   There is plenty of room here for disagreement and discussion.  There is no room for doing that in an uncivil manner.  Posters are expected to behave in a considerate manner knowing that they are interacting with people they do not know.  [Remember the human](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/human_reddiquette#wiki_please__do). With the anonymity of the internet, it is easy to say things you would never say to someone in person.  In addition, this medium does not allow tone to come through.  Please keep both of those facts in mind.

Behaviors that will not be tolerated:

* Threats

* Excessive foul language

* Harassment

* Trolling

* Personal attacks

* Excessive aggression

* Use of any kind of slur

* Inappropriate/sexual comments

* Excessive back-and-forth arguing not related to the initial thread/comment

That being said, not every abrasive/abrupt comment is a personal or targeted attack.  In most cases, posters will be warned, and the offending comment/post removed.  Repeated violations will result in a ban.


 **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  

This sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&amp;A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&amp;A thread.

If you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:

* Age

* Sex

* Current MPW + pace

* Previous peak MPW

* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed

* Goals (including specific races)

* Previous PRs

* Other things you think might be helpful to include

Below are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&amp;A thread:

* If your post is just a question in the title.

* If your post is a question in the title plus “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body.

* If your question can be asked in one sentence.

* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.

* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.

* In general, it I helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  

* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.

Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.



**(3)** -  *No self-promotion (including links to personal blogs, social media, Youtube channel, etc.), advertising, spam, or surveys. This includes giveaways, charity events, and promotional discounts.*  

Self-promotion/advertising on /r/running is not allowed.  This sub is not the place to drive traffic to your blog, Youtube channel, social media, business, whatever.  You can buy an ad from Reddit for this.  Posts and comments such as these will be removed.  Repeated offenses will result in a ban.  If your username is the name of your product/business/service, you will automatically be banned.  Check out reddit's [self-promotion guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) for more info.

In addition, surveys of any sort are not allowed.  Runnit is not a free sample population to be used.


 **(4)** - *Please do not post elite race results in the title of posts. This includes the announcing of world records in titles.*

 **(5)** - *Please make your title descriptive. This means letting readers know roughly what your post will be about before they click. “Question” is not a good title for a post. Neither is “Help needed”. Do not use excessive emoji characters in the titles of posts.*

 **(6)** - *Displaying detailed personal information of anyone other than yourself is prohibited. Submission of content focused on ousting cheaters will be removed at the moderation team's discretion.*

 **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  

While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  

There is a big difference between ""Hey, my IT band is tight.  Got any good stretches for it?""  and ""My shins hurt every time I run.  If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?""  If your question involves sharp pains or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.

Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.


 **(8)** - *Submissions must be running-related.  Do not submit photos, videos, or memes that add nothing to the discussion.*  

Running related pictures and videos are allowed, but cannot be self-promotion [Rule 3] and must have some type of intro in the text body or comments as to why Runnit should click the link [Rule 10].

 **(9)** - *The 'TMI Rule' - Individual posts highlighting bodily functions such as bowel movements will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team.*

We don't need to hear about you crapping yourself or coming home with one sock. No, it doesn't make you a ""real"" runner.

**(10)** - *When posting articles, please include some text to start a discussion about the article.*  

/r/running does not allow threads that are solely sharing a link without any engagement.  If you are going to share something, at least provide a conversation starter.   Reposts of the same news topic, even from a different source, will most likely be removed unless it offers different details.

[Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/cescf3/should_i_finish_a_race_with_a_sprint_runnersworld/) of a good lead in statement for an article thread.

###**Daily and Weekly Threads**

In order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead. Here are the current daily and weekly threads:

Finally, there is a lot of info in the Wiki.  Yes, some of it is from old posts.  Yes, the layout is not the greatest.  It is always a work in progress.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it I helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of &lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;r/running&lt;/a&gt;, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3)&lt;/strong&gt; -  &lt;em&gt;No self-promotion (including links to personal blogs, social media, Youtube channel, etc.), advertising, spam, or surveys. This includes giveaways, charity events, and promotional discounts.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-promotion/advertising on &lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;/r/running&lt;/a&gt; is not allowed.  This sub is not the place to drive traffic to your blog, Youtube channel, social media, business, whatever.  You can buy an ad from Reddit for this.  Posts and comments such as these will be removed.  Repeated offenses will result in a ban.  If your username is the name of your product/business/service, you will automatically be banned.  Check out reddit&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion""&gt;self-promotion guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, surveys of any sort are not allowed.  Runnit is not a free sample population to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Please do not post elite race results in the title of posts. This includes the announcing of world records in titles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(5)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Please make your title descriptive. This means letting readers know roughly what your post will be about before they click. “Question” is not a good title for a post. Neither is “Help needed”. Do not use excessive emoji characters in the titles of posts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(6)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Displaying detailed personal information of anyone other than yourself is prohibited. Submission of content focused on ousting cheaters will be removed at the moderation team&amp;#39;s discretion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(7)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Do not solicit medical advice. This includes &amp;#39;Has anyone else experienced this injury?&amp;#39; type posts.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between &amp;quot;Hey, my IT band is tight.  Got any good stretches for it?&amp;quot;  and &amp;quot;My shins hurt every time I run.  If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?&amp;quot;  If your question involves sharp pains or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(8)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Submissions must be running-related.  Do not submit photos, videos, or memes that add nothing to the discussion.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running related pictures and videos are allowed, but cannot be self-promotion [Rule 3] and must have some type of intro in the text body or comments as to why Runnit should click the link [Rule 10].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(9)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The &amp;#39;TMI Rule&amp;#39; - Individual posts highlighting bodily functions such as bowel movements will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need to hear about you crapping yourself or coming home with one sock. No, it doesn&amp;#39;t make you a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(10)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;When posting articles, please include some text to start a discussion about the article.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;/r/running&lt;/a&gt; does not allow threads that are solely sharing a link without any engagement.  If you are going to share something, at least provide a conversation starter.   Reposts of the same news topic, even from a different source, will most likely be removed unless it offers different details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/cescf3/should_i_finish_a_race_with_a_sprint_runnersworld/""&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt; of a good lead in statement for an article thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily and Weekly Threads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead. Here are the current daily and weekly threads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;amp;t=all""&gt;Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)&lt;/a&gt;: Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra – literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;t=all""&gt;General Q&amp;amp;A Thread (Posted daily)&lt;/a&gt;: With over 500,000 users, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don&amp;#39;t necessarily provoke useful discussion, in the daily General Q&amp;amp;A thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search/?q=%22weekly%20training%20thread%22&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1""&gt;Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)&lt;/a&gt;: This is where you will find posts on the training of your fellow runnitors for the week. Take a look at the various formats that are posted and feel free to post your own. It is also a great place to see what kind of training some of the more experienced runnitors are doing (though as mentioned, all are welcome to post). Please note that this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an accomplishment thread.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It&amp;#39;s for anyone and everyone to use who&amp;#39;d like to write up a short summary about a race or recent run they did.

He had no phone or ID on him, they had no idea who he was (though he's very proud that they estimated his age at 12 years below his actual age) or who to contact. He wasn't able to talk to tell them.

Here's the Clif's Notes version:

Booneville Backroads Ultra - 100 Mile (Covid) Edition  (http://boonevillebackroadsultra.com/)
102.5 miles - 28hrs 10min  5th male, only 9 finished, out of 24 starters (7 men, 2 women).

Weather started out cool, but the temps hit the low 90's by afternoon and stayed there until about 6:00 PM with no clouds and little wind.  Stayed in the upper 70's through the finish.

I hit a few low points; most notably at ~50 miles and ~80 miles, but managed to work through it. I became intimately in tune with the complete mental screw game a race of this distance turns into later in the game.  I had an idea of what it would be like from training, but the magnitude of it was intense.

All said though, I felt pretty positive the whole time.  In fact, on the first and second 50k loops I was singing along with my music, and on the last leg I was telling delirium fueled dad jokes to my pacers (much to their amusement).

I am friends/acquaintances with a few of the runners, whom are much better runners than me, that DNF'd, and I am in shock that I managed to finish where a few of them didn't.  That sounds like I'm casting shade at them, but I think my relatively slower pace at the start saved me versus some of their faster starts once the heat turned up.

Lastly, by the last 20ish miles walking and running hurt about the same, so I tried to run as much as possible at the end.  It went better than I expected.

The last aid station had Mountain Dew pancakes, which were freaking amazing.  Mana from the running gods.  

Anyway, I had a blast!  I worked my ass off to get to this point in my running life.  I had a ton of support from my family and friends.  I can't begin to express the level of gratitude I have for them helping and even encouraging my insanity.  

I know 100 milers aren't for everyone, but if you can manage the highs and lows of training and running it, it is worth it.

,running,"Random observation and personal zen moment I thought I'd take the time to put into words.  

So I've been running for a little over 4 years now starting as with most people, the Couch to 5K.   In that time I've run 5000+ miles since that first 0.89 'run' in 2016 and burned a little over a million calories (random personal trivia).   

Training miles, slogging miles out regardless of heat, cold, wind, rain and snow, I don't enjoy them, I don't get a runner's high, I don't feel great running at the start, middle or end, most runs are painful in some way.  To say I'm not built for running is an understatement of biblical proportions. 

I take some small satisfaction in the sense of accomplishment but no enjoyment in the struggle to get better, to go longer. 

But...

For obvious reasons I haven't run a race in 7 months.   But yesterday on U.S. Labor Day we had a small trail race locally, in person.  A 5 mile and a 2 mile combined on a local trail system that has a wide range of surfaces and verticality. 

And that long gap of no racing really dialed in 'why' I run.  As i was sitting on top of my SUV keeping an eye out for a parking spot for my running partner I had a sense of elation and anticipation I haven't felt in... 7 months.  Watching runners show up, men, women, children, obvious elites and obvious people for whom this might very well be the start of their couch to 5k program.   And I realized this is why I run.  The gathering of like minded individuals, 'my tribe' if you will.  

For the record, I'm not fast, I rarely place in my age group mostly because there's a bunch of ringers in my age group or so I tell myself.  So 'winning' a race has no meaning for me which takes a lot of the pressure off I think.  No, a race for me at best is a race with the people immediately ahead of me but mostly with myself. 

When we lined up (in waves based on estimated pacing, properly distanced from each other) we all had the same goal, to finish that course in as short a time as possible for each of us.   Whatever that time ended up being.  For the curious a 12 year old took first overall with an average pacing of just over 6 minutes for 5 miles over some pretty technical sections.   The kid is... talented. 

And over the next 50 something minutes for me, every step, including one fall, was so much fun, so much sheer enjoyment, unlike the 1000's of miles I've put in to train, that it was a giant light bulb going off.  

The race is why I do it, especially trail races but road races too.  The race is why I throw good money away to get a cheap t-shirt that gets thrown in a box and cheaper mass produced participation medal to run courses that for the part I could run any time for free.   The race is what I look forward to in this sport/activity/personal masochism we call running. 

I know everyone who runs, runs for all the reasons, someones multiple reasons at once, fitness, stress relief, to eat all the things, socially, competitively, to get out of the house, the list is literally endless.

,running,"For the past few weeks I've been going out in the morning at 4-5am to run for ab an hour around my neighborhood. I assumed my parents would be okay with it but after I mentioned it once they blew up on me saying it wasn't safe.


I get some neighborhoods arent the safest but mine is fairly safe and has security patrolling areas. I never stray too far away from my house and I can always get back within a sprint. Im 15 and I've been juggling a lot from programing,  highschool exams/assignments, keeping straight A's and a lot of stressful stuff.

,running,"...and for as small as it was, about 12-13 of us total, it was a success!

First off, mods, I apologize if this is against rules.  If it is, then I respectfully submit myself to do as you must.

Secondly, story time!   Prior to quarantine, a bunch of my cousins and some of our friends had been getting more into fitness, specifically running.  They were all looking forward to doing events that were coming up this year, but we all know what happened here.  Anyways,  when virtual race events became a thing a few months back, they looked to me (as out of our group, I had a bit more experience with running and running events) to set something up.  We ended up finding one of IRun4Movement's themes that we all thought was a fun theme and went with it.  We picked Labor Day weekend as it was a 3-day weekend and at that point, it was enough time for people to train for a 10k.  

Where most of the group lived was a flat area and most of their running was done just around their neighborhoods and local parks, so I picked a route that was a bit more scenic and had a bit more action, the Johnny Cash Trail.  This was a route my girlfriend and I had run before.  I thought it was perfect as it was a 10k that starts and ends at the same spot, there was a good change of pace as far as terrain, and it was a route with nice views that the group would not have seen otherwise.  

I set up a meeting spot and made a map of the parking location in relation to where the run would begin.  I mocked up a map of the run and did my best to describe the route as best as I could.  I set up a time for us to meet and what time we would be starting at.  I tried to give the best tips I know of what to expect on the run, how to prepare for the run, what to bring on the run, the etiquette of running on the trail, how to prepare for the hot weather (I picked an early start time because of this) etc.  I wanted to give them as much information as I could so we could all have a successful run.  For the most part, they were all running this for completion, not time, but for the ones that wanted to do it for time, I made sure to remind them to become familiar with the route.  

When yesterday came around and we were all at the meeting spot, I made sure to give reminders on all the route and all the things I pointed out.  When we started the race, I purposefully pulled ahead so I could get to parts of the route where people might get confused on where to turn.  It's a pretty straight forward route, but there are parts where you could make a wrong turn.  For the ones that fell too far behind, I sent them pictures of the checkpoints with an arrow or my hand pointing which way to go.  I had packed my hydration vest with 50/50 water gatorade mix in case anyone needed it, but luckily most everyone came prepared.  At each checkpoint, I pointed where they would go with some loud cheering to egg them on.  At the finish, my cousin's wife was there to cheer the finishers and to present them the medals.  

I know it was only a 10k, but to some of them, this was a big accomplishment.  This was the longest run they've had.  I wanted this to somewhat resemble a race day for those that haven't experience a race day yet.  In the end, everyone finished and everyone had a lot of fun doing it.  If I was to do it again, I want to come to the trail the day before and set up markers to help make it easier for those who pulled ahead to know where they're going.

My problem is when trying to take more steps per minute I end up just running faster! I have tried to shorten my stride &amp; emphasis landing on the balls of my feet with my feet under my body but I must not be doing it right because cadence doesn’t change.

,running,"### Race information
* **What?** Ramboll Stockholm Halvmarathon Virtual Edition
* **When?** September 5, 2020
* **How far?** 13,1 miles
* **Finish time** 2:40


### Background
I (50M, 94kg, 178cm), decided to run the race about 10 months ago, a few months after I took up running.

Earlier in my life there has been close to none exercise in any form. Been more into cooking, baking and champagne.

The first months of training was tough for my body. Aching and I overtrained and hurt my knee, resulting in one month recovery wo running. 
Still I'm lucky to always long for my next run. Maybe because I can do something new and challenging I never thought was possible.
Also my suprised children, used to their foodie-dad, helped my motivation a lot.

I followed Hal Higdon's Half Marathon Novice 2 program. Did a lot of the training at my country house in the summer where it was hot, humid and hilly. Soon the longer distances felt fine.

I think the program was a little too short, next time I will do more long runs, as I really feel they improve me as a runner. Perhaps Matt Fitzgerald's, also with more speedwork.

My son was supposed to join me, but things got in his way, so my son in law took his place, with short notice (in the morning of the race day, talking about time to prepare...). He's quite athletic but never done so much running.

The night before the race my mother told me that my brother only have a couple of months left to live. In many ways I think that running is emotional and this would of course affect the race.

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A |&lt; 2.30 | *No* |
| B |&lt; 2.45 | *Yes* |
| C |Finish | *Yes* |

### Pre-race
Did nothing special, tried to drink extra the day before but my stomach didn't like that. So only a couple of toasts and a coffe in the morning.

### Race
The race was virtual so we ran close to where I live, in the centre of Stockholm. A very flat trail by the water.

I don't like to eat anything during my runs, so I drank powerade instead.

First 12k was fine and my plan was to have a negative split. However when the time came to speed up I noticed that that was not going to happen. Instead I would be glad to maintain my current pace.

My son in law started to get pain in his legs, but all my bodyparts was cooperating very well. Stamina-wise it was the opposite. The last 4 km was very painful, lost the tempo completely, never felt so exhausted and dizzy before.

### Post-race
Friends and my children was waiting at the finish line and I was very happy but completely bonked.

Afterwards we had a big dinner with a lot of discussions and wine.

I'm a little bit worried that I dragged my son in law into this. Will feel guilty if he gets any injuries.


### What's next?
Next I will start a 5k program to get faster and my plan is to do a HM-training plan with more volume. I think there is a lot of room for improvement.

I've been running for 14 years since I was a freshman in high school. Any seasoned runner will know how much will have changed by now, but on top of all the physical changes I also recovered from a fractured ankle four years ago.

I have a plate and seven screws on my ankle bone but by now I can still run as vigorously as I used to. I'd just like to get some insight on what to look for when buying new shoes. I have a pair of ASICS Men's GEL Venture 5 that I may be putting out of commission for something better - both ankles have been feeling somewhat sore from running on them this past year.

What should I look for when buying the best next pair of shoes? I recently came across a shoe fitting guide that recommended I bought shoes for Stability (mid-height), but I'm also thinking I may need to look for good ankle support... Or maybe not?

**Distance: 42,2km**

**Time: 03:54:33**

**Backstory:** Stockholm Marathon was cancelled this year and they compensated runners with moving the ticket to 2021 and getting the Stockholm Virtual Run for free, so if you run a marathon between 4.9-6.9.2020 you get a t-shirt and medal. The idea of just running a marathon in Helsinki seemed a bit lack lustering so I decided to spice it up by doing 105,5 laps on the local track field. I always found track and treadmill running a bit boring since the scenery is the same, so I knew this was going to be a real challenge.

**Training:** Jogger from Finland with 1,5 years of running experience. Two weeks prior to this I ran a personal best on Helsinki Marathon (03:37:31), and I’ve been hitting a record high mileage for the past couple of weeks. I was not ready for another marathon.

**Location:** Eläintarha Athletic Field, Helsinki, Finland

**Weather:** Temperature was somewhat cool at 15-20C and 88% humidity. Only rained a little bit in the beginning of the run.

**Nutrition:** Water, sport drink, protein bar, energy gels

**Measuring distance:** I had my Garmin Fenix 5 to lap at 400m and if my clock seemed off I would correct this by running the next lap more on the inner/outer track, depending on if I was lacking some meters, or if I had too much. This was to ensure that I would run 105,5 laps

**Splits:** I started off by running the first 12 laps alone without any issues, then one of my friends joined me for about 25 laps and the laps passed without any issues. After this I ran about 15 laps alone and then another friend joined me for 10 laps. I hit the halfway point relatively easy and soon after the 70-lap mark followed. However, at this point it all started to go downhill. I started to lose the mental battle. I was completely alone and literally running in circles. I tried to focus on one lap at the time. At every lap after this one I would think “only xx laps left”. Willpower was the only thing keeping me going. I struggled for a long time and finally made it to the last 10 laps. At this point my body and mind were completely done and my pace dropped by a lot. After my final 0,5 lap I fell and just lied on the field, grateful that it was over.

**Postrace:** It was nice to challenge myself and to able to say that I’ve done it, but doubt I’ll do it again. In the end my neck and left leg were hurting from only turning and looking left. I can't imagine doing this without friends.

,running,"Hi all, I've found a new love for running. I'm successfully using it after quiting drugs to focus my mind, give me some 'me' time, let some rage out and get healthier. 

I've been running regularly for a around two months, 3 times a week and just completing the Couch to 5K app program. I felt this was the best way as I was 315lb when I started working on my nutrition back in February, and now with combined effort from running I'm at 260lb. 

Now I've got myself into the rhythm of running regularly, come rain or shine (I live in Scotland!) I'm looking at making sure I'm using the right shoes to avoid injury. 

I'm a big lad, I've been told at least I'll have high bone density, but ballistic impact from running is a lot to take on my ankles, shins and knees and I am starting to feel regardless of how much I warm up and stretch they are all starting to groan a little which is really demotivating while in the middle of a run.

I currently run on tarmac, and will be for the foreseeable. I'm wearing good fitting Nike Metcon 5' but they are very much a all-round gym/cross fit shoe and do very little to stop impact travel (as my foot goes down I can feel the vibrations traveling up my front shin). 

I am booked into a local store next week to get my gait recorded and my foot structure analysed to see what the best type of shoe will be for me. I was wondering if there were any other things I could do to make sure I avoid I just other than having more than a days rest between runs (I really need to run to help with sobriety)

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been running regularly for a around two months, 3 times a week and just completing the Couch to 5K app program. I felt this was the best way as I was 315lb when I started working on my nutrition back in February, and now with combined effort from running I&amp;#39;m at 260lb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve got myself into the rhythm of running regularly, come rain or shine (I live in Scotland!) I&amp;#39;m looking at making sure I&amp;#39;m using the right shoes to avoid injury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a big lad, I&amp;#39;ve been told at least I&amp;#39;ll have high bone density, but ballistic impact from running is a lot to take on my ankles, shins and knees and I am starting to feel regardless of how much I warm up and stretch they are all starting to groan a little which is really demotivating while in the middle of a run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently run on tarmac, and will be for the foreseeable. I&amp;#39;m wearing good fitting Nike Metcon 5&amp;#39; but they are very much a all-round gym/cross fit shoe and do very little to stop impact travel (as my foot goes down I can feel the vibrations traveling up my front shin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am booked into a local store next week to get my gait recorded and my foot structure analysed to see what the best type of shoe will be for me. I was wondering if there were any other things I could do to make sure I avoid I just other than having more than a days rest between runs (I really need to run to help with sobriety)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are their any particular makes that are better bang for your buck, are there any heavier or previously heavier people here who could share their top tips with me to keep going and avoid injury, anything you wish you had known before now?&lt;/p&gt;

,running,"Hey. If you are feeling discouraged or not willing to put on your shoes to go outside often any more, some things I have found that helped me a lot:

1) I always listen to an audiobook while running. This is the main thing that keeps me running for sure. Without it, I would get so bored listening to the rhythm of my feet hitting the ground or whatever.

Time passes so fast on a run when I'm engrossed in a book. While listening, suddenly 5km flies by. Most like listening to music on a run, and I do too, but that does not get me excited to make the effort to decide to run, because I listen to music all day at home or at work. 

If you don't want to listen to an audiobook, go for music or perhaps an app you can learn a language with. I would not enjoy running at all if I could not listen to something. Just stay safe with regards to cars and the road of course.

2) Download an app on your phone like Strava that tracks your runs. It's quite a fun game to see how you progress, and partly get you ashamed of a lull in activity by you if you see your friends constantly posting, lol. (My brother has run like 10km every day for 3 years, you're crazy...)

3) But seriously, do not worry about how fast people around you run, or how often. Just focus on yourself. You don't even have to aim to get better, just aim to keep healthy.

4) If you're feeling hurt or out of breath, just walk or stop (ideally at somewhere pretty!). There is no shame in it at all. Don't hurt yourself and make yourself dread running because you know it hurts.

In the same vein, take rest days constantly. I was running every day for a while early on and hurt my knee because of it. I highly recommend at least 1 rest day in between runs.

5) Everyone knows to buy good running shoes, but also get good running socks. I got some Injinji toesocks, where it's individual fabric for each toe. Annoying to put on (legit takes over 2 minutes lol), but stopped me getting blisters that would discourage me from running more. 

Hopefully this helps.

I’m a runner and personal trainer, and with gyms opening back up I wanted to share a workout routine for anyone who was interested. 

This workout is great for sprinters and fast mid distance runners, but could help anyone gain some lower body strength. 

Superset (3 sets)
Deadlift: Heavy weight, 3-6 reps
Power Clean: Mid weight, 6-10 reps

Superset (3 sets)
Pause Squat: Mid weight, 8-12 reps
Split Squat: Mid weight, 8-12 reps each leg

Superset (3 sets)
Box Jumps, 10-12 reps
Single Leg Box Jumps*, 6-10 reps each leg
Single Leg Squats*, 6-10 reps each leg

*Only do the single leg exercises if you feel comfortable doing so. If you are new to strength training you’ll want to work up to doing these. 

These exercises will help build strength, especially in the posterior chain, which helps your initial push out of the gate. It also works on explosive power and stamina, which help give an extra kick for sprints. 

Make sure you warm up and cool down properly! Let me know if you have any questions.

,running,"Hello everyone 

So I am a 29 year old male. I started running in early 2017. I run pretty consistently. I run about 3-4 times a week at about 3-4 miles per run. 

Since the pandemic started in March, I have been in a funk. I have not been as motivated to run as I used to be. I may run only once a week now. 

A few months ago I injured my Achilles tendonitis and had to wait for that to heal. Also my feet have been bothering me. On top of that, I may have a case of runners knee. 

Internally I believe I suffer from IBS. It has affected my runs but usually it’s not too bad. The last few months when I run, I get horrible cramps on the last mile of my run. I literally have to slow way down to make it bearable. I’m thinking it maybe nutrition related or the fact that I live in Georgia where it is hot all the time. I may not drink enough water either. 

I used to run a 5K in 22-23 minutes but lately I have been running them in 28 minutes which is horrendously slow and embarrassing. This gets me even more down than I am already am and causes me to not want to run.

&lt;p&gt;So I am a 29 year old male. I started running in early 2017. I run pretty consistently. I run about 3-4 times a week at about 3-4 miles per run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the pandemic started in March, I have been in a funk. I have not been as motivated to run as I used to be. I may run only once a week now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I injured my Achilles tendonitis and had to wait for that to heal. Also my feet have been bothering me. On top of that, I may have a case of runners knee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally I believe I suffer from IBS. It has affected my runs but usually it’s not too bad. The last few months when I run, I get horrible cramps on the last mile of my run. I literally have to slow way down to make it bearable. I’m thinking it maybe nutrition related or the fact that I live in Georgia where it is hot all the time. I may not drink enough water either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to run a 5K in 22-23 minutes but lately I have been running them in 28 minutes which is horrendously slow and embarrassing. This gets me even more down than I am already am and causes me to not want to run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any tips on how to get of this running funk? It feels like my best running days are behind me even though I know this isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;

### Training
Male, 29 years old. 

Over the last 8 years I've been a casual runner, emphasis on the casual, not more than 3 a week and stopping for months or years at a time. 1 marathon and two 1/2 marathons.  After reaching peak weight in February (work trip to US did not help) of 115kg at 6'1 I was struggling to run 5k in 35 minutes. When lock-down started I took it as a great opportunity to create a solid routine and have dropped to 96.6kg as of yesterday, mostly through CICO. I wanted to increase my runs per week but, going all out most runs, I found it really hard to run more than 2 days in a row. I stumbled across low-HR training and really liked the idea of slowly down, enjoying the runs, and still supposedly seeing the benefits. I was convinced mostly by a [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MALsI0mJ09I) by Stephen Seiler on the benefits of training mostly low intensity. I was also helped out a lot on this subreddit, so thank you to the many redditors who answered my questions!

I based my training mostly off MAF (180-age is your target max HR during a run), 151bpm for me. I know it's not massively scientific but runs felt great at that HR, even if I was slowing to a walk for the first few weeks. It felt like I was solidly in my aerobic zone. The idea is as your aerobic fitness improves you will be able to increase your pace whilst keeping a low HR, and be less susceptible to injury and fatigue not going all out. It was a bit of an epiphany for me that running slower can make you fitter, but thought it was worth a short.

For reference when running regularly last year I would call 5:45min/km a high intensity pace I could only keep up for 5km.  Over the next 12 weeks I built up my distances not worrying to much about pace, and by week 5 I started to see a great improvement in pace at the same HR. I began at around 7min/km 12 weeks ago and by last week was at 5:59/km average. It was so satisfying finding I could run faster without feeling like i'd done much more work. I know I've been very lucky in that many people find this training takes 6 months minimum, I saw good results in 3. Being cynical you could probably argue the fact I was increasing my mileage was having a much bigger impact on my pace than low-HR training, but if nothing else running slowly meant I could go from 50km a month to 210km whilst feeling not much fatigue. 

I ran every run 'easy pace'/under 151bpm (occasionally over) for 12 weeks. 5 days a week, building up to 55km a week. I didn't introduce any speed work, though I will in the next few weeks. My longest training run was 17km. 

Overall I didn't plan nearly as much as I should have for a 1/2 marathon race, but I knew I had the mileage down and I wanted to test out the low-HR training results for the last 3 months. As I was doing this solo I wasn't so worried if I had to bail out with tiredness, so that helped me push and not hold back. 

My prior PB for half marathon was 2:11, 2018, Greater Manchester Marathon. Training for that was 2 hard runs a week, and a long easy run. Not enough knowledge or understanding of training principles at all. 


### Pre-race
Went for a nice walk at lunch, had a small dinner at 17:30 and starting running at 20:30! Wife's birthday dinner the night before acted as carb load. 

### Race
KM 1-5
After 12 weeks running with my eyes fixed on my HR monitor it felt amazing to forget all that and just run. I had missed it and I had to stop myself from going too quickly! I tried to hit 5:42min/km to hit a 2 hour finish time. Felt comfortable and happy. 

KM 6-14
Feeling great and endorphins rushing to the head I decided to pick up the pace a bit, and took it below 5:15min/km. Not my best idea, and I paid for it later in the race. I'm terrible at pacing myself, and it's even harder without a pacemaker. Felt good up until km 12 though, before starting to lag. 

KM 15-20
Shortly before KM 15 I had a horrible realisation it was nearly 10pm on a Sunday, I had forgotten to bring any water and had forgotten a mask to enter a shop. As soon as I realised that, of course I started to feel dehydrated and headache appeared. I remembered a public water fountain about 2.5km away and rerouted to head there. 

It was during this period that I hit the wall twice, getting a bad stitch and having to slow down to nearly walking pace. An old shoulder injury also appeared for good measure and I grunted and squealed my way through residential streets at 10pm at night. I can't imagine how it sounded to anyone with the window open... This close to finishing and on track for a PB it would have taken my leg to fall off for me to stop and I managed to keep going. 

KM 20
Hitting the last mile is always magical in a long distance race, the pain fell away and I managed the last mile as close to a sprint as I could get to, reaching 4:25min/km in KM 20! I crossed the line and kept going for 200m just to make sure Strava would register the half marathon distance. 


### Post-race
Felt super happy, not only did I hit sub-2 hour 1/2 marathon but I got a 10km PB to boot at 55 minutes! Best of all I felt I had I had another 3-4 minutes in me, and will definitely be attempting a 10km PB attempt next week, aiming for 50 minutes. 

I can't stress enough how satisfied I've been with the low-HR training, it enabled me to run longer, enjoy my runs, stay injury free, and see a dramatic increase in my endurance. I know it's nothing revolutionary but I feel a lot of casual runners like me assumed that if you want to get faster you need to exclusively be pushing yourself as hard as you can. No Pain No Gain and all that (yes I watched the Stephen Seiler TED talk, you should too). This has completely reserved that mentality for me. I know I will need to introduce speed work to keep improving, but I couldn't be happier and more into my running as I am now.

&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male, 29 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 8 years I&amp;#39;ve been a casual runner, emphasis on the casual, not more than 3 a week and stopping for months or years at a time. 1 marathon and two 1/2 marathons.  After reaching peak weight in February (work trip to US did not help) of 115kg at 6&amp;#39;1 I was struggling to run 5k in 35 minutes. When lock-down started I took it as a great opportunity to create a solid routine and have dropped to 96.6kg as of yesterday, mostly through CICO. I wanted to increase my runs per week but, going all out most runs, I found it really hard to run more than 2 days in a row. I stumbled across low-HR training and really liked the idea of slowly down, enjoying the runs, and still supposedly seeing the benefits. I was convinced mostly by a &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MALsI0mJ09I""&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Seiler on the benefits of training mostly low intensity. I was also helped out a lot on this subreddit, so thank you to the many redditors who answered my questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I based my training mostly off MAF (180-age is your target max HR during a run), 151bpm for me. I know it&amp;#39;s not massively scientific but runs felt great at that HR, even if I was slowing to a walk for the first few weeks. It felt like I was solidly in my aerobic zone. The idea is as your aerobic fitness improves you will be able to increase your pace whilst keeping a low HR, and be less susceptible to injury and fatigue not going all out. It was a bit of an epiphany for me that running slower can make you fitter, but thought it was worth a short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference when running regularly last year I would call 5:45min/km a high intensity pace I could only keep up for 5km.  Over the next 12 weeks I built up my distances not worrying to much about pace, and by week 5 I started to see a great improvement in pace at the same HR. I began at around 7min/km 12 weeks ago and by last week was at 5:59/km average. It was so satisfying finding I could run faster without feeling like i&amp;#39;d done much more work. I know I&amp;#39;ve been very lucky in that many people find this training takes 6 months minimum, I saw good results in 3. Being cynical you could probably argue the fact I was increasing my mileage was having a much bigger impact on my pace than low-HR training, but if nothing else running slowly meant I could go from 50km a month to 210km whilst feeling not much fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran every run &amp;#39;easy pace&amp;#39;/under 151bpm (occasionally over) for 12 weeks. 5 days a week, building up to 55km a week. I didn&amp;#39;t introduce any speed work, though I will in the next few weeks. My longest training run was 17km. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I didn&amp;#39;t plan nearly as much as I should have for a 1/2 marathon race, but I knew I had the mileage down and I wanted to test out the low-HR training results for the last 3 months. As I was doing this solo I wasn&amp;#39;t so worried if I had to bail out with tiredness, so that helped me push and not hold back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My prior PB for half marathon was 2:11, 2018, Greater Manchester Marathon. Training for that was 2 hard runs a week, and a long easy run. Not enough knowledge or understanding of training principles at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went for a nice walk at lunch, had a small dinner at 17:30 and starting running at 20:30! Wife&amp;#39;s birthday dinner the night before acted as carb load. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KM 1-5
After 12 weeks running with my eyes fixed on my HR monitor it felt amazing to forget all that and just run. I had missed it and I had to stop myself from going too quickly! I tried to hit 5:42min/km to hit a 2 hour finish time. Felt comfortable and happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KM 6-14
Feeling great and endorphins rushing to the head I decided to pick up the pace a bit, and took it below 5:15min/km. Not my best idea, and I paid for it later in the race. I&amp;#39;m terrible at pacing myself, and it&amp;#39;s even harder without a pacemaker. Felt good up until km 12 though, before starting to lag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KM 15-20
Shortly before KM 15 I had a horrible realisation it was nearly 10pm on a Sunday, I had forgotten to bring any water and had forgotten a mask to enter a shop. As soon as I realised that, of course I started to feel dehydrated and headache appeared. I remembered a public water fountain about 2.5km away and rerouted to head there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was during this period that I hit the wall twice, getting a bad stitch and having to slow down to nearly walking pace. An old shoulder injury also appeared for good measure and I grunted and squealed my way through residential streets at 10pm at night. I can&amp;#39;t imagine how it sounded to anyone with the window open... This close to finishing and on track for a PB it would have taken my leg to fall off for me to stop and I managed to keep going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KM 20
Hitting the last mile is always magical in a long distance race, the pain fell away and I managed the last mile as close to a sprint as I could get to, reaching 4:25min/km in KM 20! I crossed the line and kept going for 200m just to make sure Strava would register the half marathon distance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felt super happy, not only did I hit sub-2 hour 1/2 marathon but I got a 10km PB to boot at 55 minutes! Best of all I felt I had I had another 3-4 minutes in me, and will definitely be attempting a 10km PB attempt next week, aiming for 50 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t stress enough how satisfied I&amp;#39;ve been with the low-HR training, it enabled me to run longer, enjoy my runs, stay injury free, and see a dramatic increase in my endurance. I know it&amp;#39;s nothing revolutionary but I feel a lot of casual runners like me assumed that if you want to get faster you need to exclusively be pushing yourself as hard as you can. No Pain No Gain and all that (yes I watched the Stephen Seiler TED talk, you should too). This has completely reserved that mentality for me. I know I will need to introduce speed work to keep improving, but I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier and more into my running as I am now. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

\### Training

I had been trying to run a few times a week since I got my new running watch for Christmas. It was getting a little rough right before we went into lockdown in March, I just didn't have the time to fit in runs with my job (teacher) and my kids. (Especially after track season started, because my partner coaches, leaving me to handle all after school activities until he got home.) But after we went into lockdown, I started getting very consistent in my running schedule. I ended up taking most of May off due to an injury, and then the summer was sort of sporadic what with vacations and the oppressive summer heat. For the past month I upped my weekly mileage and my pace, knowing that I was going to get to run in an actual race Labor Day weekend. My training was solely roads, though. The last time I trail ran was in March.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

The USNWC decided to open the course at 7 AM and close it at 3 PM. We were able to enter and run at any time. The starting line wasn't as crowded as it usually is, but there were quite a few people milling about. There were people there cheering runners as they crossed the finish line, and with the music playing it had the same feeling as a regular race. I wore my mask up until I crossed the start line, because safety first. When my partner looked at me and said, ""Are you ready? Let's go,"" I actually teared up a little bit. We missed about four of our usual Spring and Summer races, and every time we'd hear that one was cancelled it felt like we may never actually run in a race again. It just felt so good to be back in that pre-race atmosphere again that I almost didn't want to leave to start the race.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Since it was the first time I'd been on a train in months, I wasn't planning on breaking any records. I wanted to run strong, and I told myself that I shouldn't be longer than 40 minutes. One of the first things I realized was that I missed the toe spread I have in my road shoes, Altra Escalante Racers. I wear Merrell Trail Gloves for trail, and suddenly I felt like they really too tight and glove-like. I'm definitely going to try a pair of Altra trail shoes before the next trail race.

I had never run a trail racer with a staggered start, and it was glorious. There was no bottlenecking on the trail, which was good because this course was on a very narrow trail. Most places required you to get off the trail to let someone pass, which is always a struggle when you start in a large group. There were people running on the trail, I was passed a few times and I passed some people. Early on I realized that everyone who passed me was giving me some encouragement as they ran by. This was the first race for most of us since quarantine, and you could really feel the community. I made sure to say something positive to the people I passed, just wanting to pass on the good feeling. That was what the race was about to me, just feeling good about being out running with others.

After I saw my second split, I decided I was going to have to reassess my goal of 40 minutes. I was going MUCH slower on the trail than I had anticipated. I think several things contributed to me being slow: first time on a trail since March; a very narrow, tight, and tree root-y trail; and not having my usual landmarks to pace off. I told myself that I could be happy with 45 minutes, as long as I finished strong. I knew the last bit towards the finish line is a hill, and after I left the woods I reminded myself I had trained for this by running up a much steeper hill in my neighborhood at the end of my runs, so there were no excuses. I glanced at my watch as I got closer and saw it was under 40. I knew I couldn't clear the hill in one minute, but I was going to be close. I crossed the finish line feeling good about myself, which is not how I usually cross the finish line.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

I got water and waited for my partner. This was the first race we've ever run where I've beat him. I don't feel particularly proud of that because he hasn't been training at all, but he never really does any sort of training and he still always beats me. I think it boils down to stride length, so even if I'm in better shape I can't outrun him.

We hung out and watched some of Team USA canoe and kayak on their training runs on the whitewater, then we had a beer. We went to lunch at a brewery, and then home for a nap. 

I was hoping to run today, but I woke up with very stiff and wonky knees. It's probably a result of trail running and the fact I missed a week with my RA medicine. So I'll be back out tomorrow morning, early, before my first day of virtual teaching. I have a feeling teaching virtually is going to mean my weekly mileage dramatically increases, because I just can't sit in front of a computer for very long without losing my mind. 

Cheers to everyone who ran this weekend!

,running,"Some background: Two months ago I suffered a mild ankle sprain after falling while playing with my puppy. Don't worry, no dogs were harmed in the making of this fall.  I had just run my first 10k and was making good progress before I took time off to recover. I was out about two &amp; 1/2 weeks before I started running again.

,running,"Hey everyone. I’m not sure whose interested, but I thought I’d share about my in person race experience during COVID 19. 

Firstly, the race was supposed to be in May and got rescheduled to today. Along with rescheduling the race, the actual course and start time got moved as well. 

The race incorporated a 5k, half, and full marathon. In order to social distance the race was changed to the entire weekend, September 5-7. 5k and half marathon runners were to run Saturday or Monday, with marathoners running on Sunday. Each runner registered online for a start time. Runners could sign up from 5AM to 11AM, with five runners allowed to sign up in each five minute increment. If runners felt uncomfortable, they were allowed to sign up virtual and submit their time between August 1st and September 7th. 

Due to the race being changed to over 3 days, the course itself changed as well. This was due to the original race being on part of a public road, which they couldn’t shut down for 3 days. The course was changed to a local, beautiful running trail with a similar elevation change. 

Packet pick ups were offered over 5 days at different locations to promote social distancing. In order to avoid personal contact at the end of the race, finisher medals and t-shirts were provided during this time. 

Aid stations handed out full, sealed water and Gatorade bottles, along with gels. Runners were not allowed to stop at stations but needed to continue to walk to avoid crowding. 

Once finished, snack bags were provided for quick grab-and-go to get people in and out. Due to the different start times and virtual option, no placement awards were given.

Hello fellow runners,

I have been a road runner since long and have started trail running off late. I am yet to buy a trail running shoe. For road running, I use the Asics Gel Kayano 23 (may need an upgrade). Now, as I am new to trail running, I have been looking for some shoes online and my friend recommended Altra Timp 2.0. Now after reading several reviews online I am unsure if they would be the best fit for me.
The most common complain is: ‘narrow around the mid-sole’ , ‘need time to break in’, ‘boxy toes’. 
I had Skechers Go Meb Speed 4 a couple of years back and they were also too tight around mid sole and were very uncomfortable for me. So, don’t want to fall into that trap again.

I haven't had a proper plan for running, started off with quick easy runs at the start of my journey and I have been experimenting also incorporating longer and slower runs. 

anyways as a kid I used to be active but during my teenage years I really fell off and lived an extremely stationary life. I'm 18 now and I'm trying to pay more attention to my body. I think I've noticed that my core is like EXTREMELY weak. it's something I've always never paid attention to. when running I've noticed my body posture is a bit flimsy as the miles pile on and I have to correct it quite a lot. also if I do any type of sprints or run at a fast pace I've noticed that I kind of sink downwards? I'm not tall at all but I've seen that like my body goes lower down towards gravity especially when sprinting? I dunno if that made sense at all. it's like my legs are slowly sinking into the ground as I reach the end of a sprint/fast paced run (I don't think it's due to weak legs as I train these regularly)

well as soon as I heard that I could possibly have a weak core I immediately did some core excercises just to check it out (like some ab workouts) and most of the pain from the workouts hurt my lower back.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to run religiously from about 2k14 - 2k16. During this time, I ran pretty much solely (hehe) in Nike Frees. I was never a long-distance runner and mainly focused on my goal which was to run a 12 minute 3km. I achieved that goal and pretty much lost interest in running as a hobby because I had other cardio-intensive sports. Anyway, I recently decided that I was going to get back into running so I bought a pair of Brooks GTS 18's last year. I've done some running in them, and I just struggle. My legs ache, and I really slow. I think this is mostly due to the fact that they somewhat inhibit my ability to run on my toes - as I'm not a mid-striker. Do you guys think it's work going back to a minimalist shoe in order to get that performance back? Furthermore, do you think that the type of shoe you use really affects performance? Because I feel like just being in this shoe makes me feel as though I'm going to have a crap run every time I put them on.

,running,"I targeted 2020 for my 5th marathon- I've been running for 17+ years, so I know my way around the sport.  Everything from 5ks and up, speedwork, tempos, all that.  I've really felt good thru the training, and I'm doing 50+ mile weeks.  

About a week and a half ago, I felt a twinge in my hamstring that seemed like more than muscle soreness.  So I tried to be smart about it and took 5 days off including a long run that week.  Thankfully, it seems that was enough to get me back on track and the leg is feeling a lot better.  

However, this past week all my runs have been very labored.  I can't hold my pace very well, and my HR is showing it.

I did some recovery runs after, when typically my HR has held in the 140s and im now in the 160-170s for the same pace.

Thankfully, it seems that was enough to get me back on track and the leg is feeling a lot better.  &lt;/p&gt;

,running,"Ive started running regularly in the last 2 months with my son in a jogging stroller. I am overweight and have messed up feet from a history of dance and the weight gain. But my body is really good about endurance and building strength quickly so Ive made crazy progess.

Ive posted twice now on this subreddit trying to figure out what is happening to my feet. Ive been through Mizuno Inspires, Hoka Arahis, Saucony Guides... all different sizes and widths. All at some running shoe stores guidance. My feet did a number of weird things in each. Left usually turned sideways in the shoe and couldnt catch any weight on my big toe. Heels moved in both as my foot tried to counteract the so called support (had to stop every 100 yards or so to either kick my foot around or straight up relace my shoes or stuff something in the toe box). I basically had to walk if there was any incline or decline, because there was no way I could keep both feet in the shoe in a normal shape. I was losing my mind.

So today I went to Dicks just to find a very light, regular running shoe. I picked a few I thought looked lighter but supportive, and the girl asked before she went to find my size in the back if there were any others I wanted. I VERY randomly picked up a pair of lilac Nike Flex Experience 9s because I liked the color....


Tried the other shoes on, all the same. Toes felt weird, heels felt weird, felt like strapping a concrete block to my feet. Then I tried on the Nikes.

They are my normal shoe size, no ""extra room"" according to fitting size and common knowledge. But OH. MY. GOD. My feet are in the right place for the first time. The material is stretchy so my toes can move and find the ground. In a tapered toe box of a stability shoe that is a size up, my big toe slides up which then lets my foot roll in the shoe. This toe box is more squared so it cant roll. What Im getting at is these shoes are more supportive by far than any of the shoes Ive tried that are supposed to be that way.

Even though my posts have not been popular in the subreddit, I want to put my experience out there because I want other novice runners like me to know they arent crazy for ignoring what the running shoe experts are telling them. I know my opinion is not necessarily unique, but Im one of those people that likes to trust the ""expert opinion"" ""high tech"" hype out there. That outlook has made the last few months miserable.

I am overweight and have messed up feet from a history of dance and the weight gain. But my body is really good about endurance and building strength quickly so Ive made crazy progess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive posted twice now on this subreddit trying to figure out what is happening to my feet. Ive been through Mizuno Inspires, Hoka Arahis, Saucony Guides... all different sizes and widths. All at some running shoe stores guidance. My feet did a number of weird things in each. Left usually turned sideways in the shoe and couldnt catch any weight on my big toe. Heels moved in both as my foot tried to counteract the so called support (had to stop every 100 yards or so to either kick my foot around or straight up relace my shoes or stuff something in the toe box). I basically had to walk if there was any incline or decline, because there was no way I could keep both feet in the shoe in a normal shape. I was losing my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I went to Dicks just to find a very light, regular running shoe. I picked a few I thought looked lighter but supportive, and the girl asked before she went to find my size in the back if there were any others I wanted.

,running,"I dunno what I’m supposed to say! I just ran my first 10 miles in 01:40:31!

I ran until shirt was saturated with sweat, my shorts were getting there, my hat was dripping sweat into my eyes, my bandaids fell off my nips and my left nip started bleeding. But I did it! 10 miles, consecutively.

I’ve been hiking for years now, and have been lightly running on and off but it was back in July where I started taking running seriously with 5ks on the regular. 5ks M/W/F with 7mi walks and 9+ mile hikes in between. I started adding a 10k in about a month ago, which has slowly been going farther with my last attempt being a 12k. 

I eat a vegan diet, last night was actually a vegan pizza which might explain why I had the energy to push! I’m still like 20 pounds over my goal weight of 190, but I’m so happy with my times and progress even being overweight as I am! It’s just pushing for the sake of being able to go farther and harder than I have previously, and I live for that!

I’m just running off of that level 2 fun vibe right now! Yeah, it sucked and I was tired and angry and pushing myself. But at a 06:12/km pace, I’m happy with my results, I’m happy with myself, I’m happy with my fitness journey and progress, and I can’t wait to keep going. Just for me, my sake and my health. Running has absolutely become something that I love as much as hiking, and I want to keep going!! But I think I’m going to take the rest of the weekend off and just do yoga and walk haha!

,running,"**Background**
M/45

I started running in April because my gym closed due to corona. I typically do long (for me) runs at low heart rate (120-135'ish, usually in the high 120's) a couple times a week, do shorter runs at medium heart rate (&lt;150) a couple times a week, and occasionally do a speed-focused workout, a couple times a month. No real plan, but it's difficult to stick to anything due to the horrendous heat and my odd-hours work schedule. I total 25-40km most weeks.

This summer has been absolutely horrific, with daily temperatures between 30-36 Celsius and humidity rarely dropping below 80%, often 90%+. So I've slowed down a lot, while at the same time I think my fitness is still improving.

I take runs as they come because I never know how I'll respond on the day, sometimes cutting distance in half, slowing down nearly to a crawl, etc.

But on the other hand, sometimes I'll just have a really great day and increase my pace a bit, as long as my heart rate doesn't go up too high.

About a week ago, it was 32 Celsius and 76% humidity, and I went out with the intention of doing a medium-pace 5km, keeping my heart rate around 145. After the first km, I felt so good I thought 'why not pick up the pace and go for a PR?', so I did, and I did.

Based on the above, and my fastest mile being about 7:06, plus I'm still fairly new so I've never actually tried to push into major discomfort, what sort of target pace might I shoot for if I decide to enter a 5km in the fall when the weather cools down?",t2_4if864it,False,,0,False,5km pace advice from experienced runners?,[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-question,0,,False,t3_inaqzf,False,dark,0.6,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599374800.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;
M/45&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started running in April because my gym closed due to corona. I typically do long (for me) runs at low heart rate (120-135&amp;#39;ish, usually in the high 120&amp;#39;s) a couple times a week, do shorter runs at medium heart rate (&amp;lt;150) a couple times a week, and occasionally do a speed-focused workout, a couple times a month. No real plan, but it&amp;#39;s difficult to stick to anything due to the horrendous heat and my odd-hours work schedule. I total 25-40km most weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer has been absolutely horrific, with daily temperatures between 30-36 Celsius and humidity rarely dropping below 80%, often 90%+. So I&amp;#39;ve slowed down a lot, while at the same time I think my fitness is still improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take runs as they come because I never know how I&amp;#39;ll respond on the day, sometimes cutting distance in half, slowing down nearly to a crawl, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, sometimes I&amp;#39;ll just have a really great day and increase my pace a bit, as long as my heart rate doesn&amp;#39;t go up too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, it was 32 Celsius and 76% humidity, and I went out with the intention of doing a medium-pace 5km, keeping my heart rate around 145. After the first km, I felt so good I thought &amp;#39;why not pick up the pace and go for a PR?&amp;#39;, so I did, and I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 - 5:30 (HR 145)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 - 5:13 (HR 150)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 - 5:06 (HR 159)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 - 4:58 (HR 167)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 - 4:42 (HR 175)
Total: 25:29 (5:06 avg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,running,"One of the most common things I see repeated in this Subreddit is the advice to ""Slow down"" - indeed, in certain scenarios I think this advice is well put.  But more often then not I see people advocating ""slowing down"" the pace of runs to other posters when they are missing any information which would indicate this is worth doing, and I think this comes from some foundational misunderstanding of WHY slowing down is ever good advice.

So when is slowing down the right thing to do, and why?  There are two scenarios where this makes sense

1. For people who are BRAND NEW to running, as in, still haven't completed a 2 mile run, have basically no idea what running is even supposed to feel like, ""slow down"" can be a useful cue to them, as unless you did XC or Track in school, you've likely gone your whole life either walking or sprinting, and it takes exploration to learn that there sub-maximal paces you're supposed to run at.
2. For people who are at the limit of the intensity stress they can manage at their current fitness and need to focus on quality workout days.  This ""slow down"" advice is good, because it maximizes the recovery effect the athlete gets on their easy, aerobic days, SO THAT THEY CAN PERFORM WELL ON THEIR WORKOUT DAYS.

What I see very often is people talking about low HR training when for all I can tell they run 25 miles a week, all at an easy pace.  Or posters advocating someone training for military fitness testing ""slow down"" their runs.  Or posters talking about walking up hills because their HRM goes out of whatever zone its supposed to be in when they attempt to run up them.  This is really wrong headed and it seems to be like nothing earns plaudits like telling someone to slow down without any real thought in whether or not that is actually good advice.

It makes little sense to me why this is repeated so frequently on this subreddit - that ""easy days should be easy"".  Yes, that tautology is illuminating, but this is a really ineffective foundation for a training plan.  Most people who run regularly do 0 workouts each week, they just do easy running - let me make this perfectly clear, if you don't do structured workouts, what the fuck are you running so ""easy"" for?   Doing this at low HR, true recovery pace has got to be *agonizing* and is flat out ineffective.  If you're going to run an unstructured plan (just ""base building"") go out and grind every now and then, pound out some miles hard.  You don't need to keep your HR at 125, what are you saving all that recovery for?  The rest day tomorrow?  Just go bang 'em out.

Like, even put the physiology to the side for a second, who is having fun checking their HRM every 15 seconds just so they get to run at a pace which is physically frustrating in how slow it is?  Part of developing as a runner is finding ways to make the activity of running enjoyable, exploring the range of paces and intensities is a huge part of that, and many posters on this sub are way too quick to jettison that because they have this impression that actually exerting yourself on a run is going to leave your body in shambles.

I know many people understand this principle, but I thought I would put a fine point on it, ""Slow down"" is effective advice in about 1 out of every 8 instances it is given on this subreddit.

To start with I am a fairly long-legged man. I am also very thin (5'10'', 135 lbs). I'm assuming that your proportions make a significant impact on optimal running form.

I've have been running some weeks now, to the point where I can maintain a fairly brisk pace, with a longer stride and a forefoot strike for my usual 6 mi run.

The thing that seems unusual, is that my arms tend to hang down near my hips, with around a 120 degree angle at the elbow. Like this, I swing them much less and instead there seems to be back-and-forth rotation of my shoulders generated by my core, it feels. Also I feel almost like I am leaning forward.

Running this way feels very natural at that pace. It kinda feels like I am swimming on land, actually. But this all seems contrary to what I read online about proper form. Most sources suggest keeping the arms higher, and generating the upper body motion at the shoulders themselves by moving the arms.

It was really just annoying up until a few days ago when it, this may sound dramatic, it literally felt like a shit ton of tiny needles just poking into my skin and it actually hurt so bad and I could do nothing for it except endure it and try to not look like I'm having a seizure to all the cars driving past me.  It was the worst experience of this problem so far, and I don't really know what exactly is causing this and I was really just wondering if anyone else had/has this, uh, thing and what you did to combat it, because Google didn't help me whatsoever.

,running,"I am interested in running a half marathon in December to celebrate the one-year anniversary of my kidney transplant, but my job presents some difficulty for training. 

I am on a conservation crew where I work eight 10-hour days followed by 6 days off. An average day's work includes anywhere from 3-15 miles per day of hiking with a heavy pack plus clearing downed trees with crosscut saws. We camp when we're on project, so after working from 7am-5:30pm, we have camp chores, so I maybe have one free hour between work and when it gets dark.

I have 13 weeks before the half I'd like to enter, currently run about 15 miles a week (when not on project) and my 5k time is 28:05. In my off weeks, I usually do two easy 3 mile runs, one fast interval run, and one ""long"" run of 5-6 miles.

So I guess my question is, how can I prepare for a half marathon while spending 8 days of every 14 in the backcountry? I can probably squeeze in a 20-30 minute run on the trail in the evening but frankly I'm usually too tired from the work day to even think about it. Can I expect my hiking miles to contribute toward my running fitness? I mean, obviously, my extremely physical job does help my overall fitness, but I don't find ""hiking shape"" to be exactly parallel to ""running shape.""

A few weeks ago I was able to do a time trial of 6:22 down from 6:59 a few weeks before that. But last night I went to the track and was feeling good! Did a couple warm up laps with some strides.

I've tried to read as much on here as I can and follow the - in my perception - best advice to transition from a person who ""just runs"" to someone who takes their running more seriously.

Slow down. Add miles. Build slowly. Don't get hurt.

So here I am, several weeks later, as stated in my title. The running feels good and I'm thrilled to be covering even 23 miles in a week, but is that enough volume to get faster or do I need to add more miles... because running more than 5 hours a week seems kind of excessive to me.

I'm going by the Maffletone Method, which I understand can take 6 months to start seeing results, but I just wanted to be sure before I invest 114 hours (give or take) to the pursuit.

Here's what my weekly runs look like:

I’ve really struggled with keeping up with my work outs while gyms have been closed, so I decided today that I want to run a half marathon. I know from previous experience that having something to train towards will help keep me honest about sticking to a routine.

I used to run a decent amount, and did 3 half marathons in 2016 (two of them were back to back weekends). But I took a long break at the end of that year, and didn’t pick up my running shoes again until this spring. 

I’ve sporadically done a few 5ks around my neighborhood, but my mileage is currently shit. Also some casual bike rides for an hour once a week or so. I’m out of shape but I’m not completely immobile.

I picked a date 12 weeks from now, but I noticed that the San Francisco Marathon is doing a virtual race 10 weeks. Paying money to do a thing, and having an official date that can’t be moved, would be really good motivators for me to keep on track. (Id also love to get a tshirt and medal for the effort).

Some of my grandmothers’ favorite childhood stories to tell about me revolve around the elaborate excuses I used to make up so that I wouldn’t be forced to go on an after dinner walk with her. It took me a long time in life to grasp that exercising wasn’t just about losing weight, but about maintaining a healthy lifestyle in general. I always saw running as kind of the peak of athleticism (at least in the casual sense) and seeing as how walks were tough for me even as a kid, I didn’t think I’d ever call myself a runner. 

A little over a year ago I decided I wanted to make some lifestyle changes to my diet and exercise habits. The day after Xmas I went for my first ever run outside  of the gym. It took me around 15 minutes to run a mile. Since then, my running journey has had lots of peaks and valleys. I felt like I was having a break through a few months ago, but then I developed shin splints which sidelined and really demoralized me. I’ve been taking it painfully slow since then, doing short/moderate recovery runs mostly around my neighborhood. 

I’m staying in a different city for work right now and decided to check out a new trail behind my hotel for a run this morning. The run felt pretty comfortable and relaxed, and although I knew I’d gone farther than my customary 2.3 miles or so I didn’t think I was nearing 5k. Y’all can’t imagine the shock I expected when I paused my run and saw that I’d not only run 3.13 miles, but that I’d done it in 29:48 at a 9:31/min pace!!

I am supposed to be running my first marathon at the end of this month (Sept 27th). I ran a half in May and felt great at the end, zero issues, so I kept up my training at the same pace (including rest weeks) to get me to my marathon. Here is my issue:

THIS IS SO HARD and for the first time EVER, I am afraid I won't be able to do this. I made it to 16-18 mile long runs, but then had to start alternating walking/running toward the end. My body is tired ALL the time and my average pace for my short easy runs (&lt;5 miles) has slowed down by 1:30-2:00 min/mile. My nutrition hasn't changed and I'm taking extra rest days if my body needs it based on how it feels and my resting HR. I did a 20 mile run last Sat and felt sick at the end, not looking forward to my next/last 20 miler before my race.

Is this normal for my first marathon? Did I overtrain? My race is virtual now, so I'm afraid the ""race high"" won't be there to push me the last 6.2 miles, especially when the last few miles of my long training runs have been miserable. I'm picking an easy route with a gradual downhill the whole way, and I understand running a marathon is supposed to be hard, but is it supposed to be THIS hard?

,running,"So this past winter is when I really started to get into running.  So much so, that I signed up for a half marathon in April.  My training was going excellent, I was running about 25-30ish miles a week, including my long runs on the weekend which were 8-11 miles.  Then Covid hit and my run was cancelled.  I was super bummed, and fell off the wagon for running for a bit, but got back into it in May, and in June I felt good enough to sign up for another half marathon to makeup for the one that had been cancelled.  In late June I got sick, then right after I got better I had a 2 week long vacation.  When I got back in Mid/late July, I promised myself I would start training hard for my half marathon on 9/20/20.

I got lazy and didn't do any training until the end of August.  Now, with the race coming up in 16 days, how crazy would I be for attempting it?  I'm a 22M in pretty decent physical shape, and my starting point for training was obviously a bit better than it had been when I first started this past winter, but I did lose quite a bit of my endurance and strength.

I'm not worried about my time or if I have to walk more than I typically would want, but I just want some perspective on if this is something I should even try.  My main concern would be injury.

,running,"I have a weird (because I do not understand it) question:

Today I did a 4km run with a really fast 5:35/km (compared to my usual runs) pace. It had to smaller hills in it (72m elevation), I was close to dying (near max effort) and my pulse averaged at 154bpm (max was 171bmp).

Compared to my normal 5km run which also has a small hill in it (44m elevation), where my pulse averages around 160-166bpm with max being at 181bpm but I don't go full effort \~6:30/km pace.

I have had this phenomenon once before, but thought that maybe my watch (Garmin fenix 6) didn't read the pulse correctly, but since today I had the exact same experience I think it's not the fault of my watch.

Why is my pulse not going higher even though I am at full effort? Could it be that my lungs are the restricting part here? What would you suggest training wise?

I was under the assumption, that heart rate is a pretty good indication for my fitness level (doing a faster pace at same heart rate or same pace at lower heart rate means improvement) but comparing my runs, this is not the case...

EDIT: Since most of you believe this to be a fault of my watch, I've ordered a chest strap and will look if it still happens (that a significant increase in intensity will not result in a higher pulse).

,running,"Hey everyone, another new lockdown runner here! I've been following this sub religiously for the past few months and now I have my own story!

So here is is... 
I've had my MIL staying with me for a while now, which for the most part has been ok, however, last night she had her cousin and 11 year old daughter swing by my place for a cuppa. Cousin and daughter had been in 5 minutes when I hear her mention that daughter had been off school and when MIL asked why, she said it was for a sore leg. Phew, I thought!
I venture out of my room to say hello and ask how the cousin is, and she replies with ""not great""... ""Why?"" I ask. She then tells me she has this ""horrible cold"" and then I remember she's an insane covid denying moron. Great...

Long story short, I've been very careful covid wise. Paranoid, some have said, but whatever. I very quickly feel a surge of adrenaline, serious fight or flight feelings. In that moment, I don't know if I'm going to scream, cry, or just straight up punch this selfish, ignorant B**TARD who's currently sitting on my sis next to my elderly MIL.

Then it hit me, there was another option... I stormed out the room, aggressively laced up my new Brooks Ghost 12's and just left. I got out into the street, shaking and crying, and just started running. 14.2km and 1hr 9min later and I was calm. Angry, but calm.

It's now the next morning, my ankles and calves are a little achey, but other than that I'm fine.

Had I not gone on that run, it's likely I would have called every mutual acquaintance of this woman and told them what she's done and probably would've made myself out to be an utter psycho in the process. I also probably wouldn't have slept and would be sitting here in a migraine fog right now. Instead I've just sent out a group text and left it at that.

Sorry for the stupidly long post, I just really wanted to share!

Love you's,
Stay safe!

His finish time was obviously 1:59:40.  26.2 miles is 42,160 meters ... and I found a reference to an average stride length for him of about 1.91 meters.

42,160 meters divided by the average stride length means he took an estimated 22,073 steps during the race.

Elite 5% runners - according to Garmin data - have a ground contact time of 210ms or below.  I don't have a value for Kipchoge, but if we assume it's that or less ... that's about 420ms on the ground per full stride ... yes?  That should mean he spent about 42% of his time in contact with the ground (50 minutes) and the remainder of the time (69 minutes) in the air.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a morning runner. I have no issues waking up to go do a run. However, I work 7 days a week, usually 10-12 hours (working on a political campaign, no days off until Nov. 4).  I pretty much work through all the hours of daylight.  I am also a 24F.

I usually wake up to run around 6 AM, but it's been staying dark until about 6:30 AM.  I live in a relatively safe area, but it is really hard for me to work up the courage to run while it's dark.  I think seeing lots of stories of women going on a run and not coming back have been at the forefront of my mind lately. I also received some of those scam texts that have been rumored to be part of human trafficking which doesn't help either (I haven't clicked the link but still freaks me out).  

I've been contemplating getting pepper spray or a go guarded ring to make me feel better, but I am not sure if those will help. Does anyone have any safety recommendations?

,running,"Tl;dr Humidity impacts performance, cross training is important, trying for something (anything!) can boost morale.

I ran my first 100 miles in a month this past August. I got the idea in little before June because Garmin brought out at badge for running 100 miles in a month. 

Prior to this, I had been off and on with running. Going way back 7-8 years, I had run 2 marathons. Took a long break from running (background prior was in an anaerobic sports), and surfaced back with some 5ks and a couple 1/2 marathons the last 3 years. I switched jobs last summer and found myself running to deal with the stress like a lot of other folks. Eventually decided on a 1/2 marathon for this past April, and in February, had logged 56.7 (most for me at the time in a month) miles including PRs in a 5k and 10k.  Midway through March things came to stand still due to pandemic.

I started to pick it up again at the end of May, and then with this Garmin badge goal, thought why not go for it. It’s roughly ~3.3 ish miles a day for a month. And yes, I know that sounds crazy because rest is important! Anyway, I pick it back up in June and naturally tweak my knee and hamstring. I take time off and and was fairly discouraged. I try to pick it back up in July (another badge made available, so a chance for redemption), but lose some momentum and know I’m not going to make it. Still, I’m running more than I had been and though it’s brutally hot, try to keep at it. Log 61.5 miles, topping my prior most in a month. 

Even not making the 100 miles, it still felt pretty good seeing how much more I had ran than in the past. August I thought I’d give it a shot since I was in a routine and feeling good. I was prioritizing my rest days and including longer runs in the week which became something to love/hate, but an interesting distraction to focus on. A small getaway in the middle of the month had me not run at all for 3 days in a row, but I bounced back and finished August with 100.4 miles. 

I feel like I learned a few things. One, humidity and heat hinders my personal performance way more than the cold. I did tie my 5K PR from February in the summer, but did not reach my best pace in my longer runs. And I felt the difference sweating my butt off. Two, cross training helps. My running in the Winter was mixed with some other activities. I was on the bike trainer a lot and did some more body weight exercises. This summer, I had tunnel vision focusing only on hitting the road and trying to get my run in. I feel like I was not as strong, which may have played a part with not achieving my faster pace. 

My big mistake is Garmin did not have a 100 mile running badge for August, the whole reason I had this idea to begin with (that’s a joke, but also a legit bummer for me). Either way, I’m happy I went through this experience. Not training for anything in particular now, but feel like I have a solid foundation. Slight fear that I prioritized quantity over quality during this experiment, but now I can put a larger focus on incorporating interval training and the other cross training.

The one that either gave you the results you were looking for, or fit your lifestyle/pace, the one where you actually looked forward to running, but most importantly, the one you saw through all the way until the end. 

I’ve gone through a few programs before. I started out just doing the Nike Run club “guided runs” every couple of days depending on how I felt (always like a relaxed recovery run.) Eventually I began one of the workout plans they have (get started) and was enjoying it. Eventually of course life got in the way and I missed one day which turned into one week and I quit the program because I didn’t like that I had missed so many prescribed workouts. I’ve started those NRC training programs several times only to get about halfway through one before something comes up (life happens.)

I’ve also tried various other running plans (C25K, Hal Higdon training plans, creating my own, etc.)

Somewhere down the line though I always end up falling off, taking a few days/weeks/months off running and noticing that what little progress I felt like I made from the last stretch was gone.

,running,"I'm sure the answer is yes, but I wanted to write a longer post talking about my last 2 weeks and hopefully some of you awesome Redditors can offer a little help or guidance. Because right now... this kinda sucks.

Some backstory: I (27M) hit my limit a few weeks ago. I'm 6'3 and I have always had a large build, but I finally topped out at 250 lbs and decided it was time to kick myself into gear. I was athletic growing up, but I fear that those days are long gone. My wife and I decided it was time to work together to get back into shape. I am hoping to lose \~30-40lbs (does this seem like a good amount?) while my wife hopes to lose \~15.

2 weeks ago we started waking up M/W/F at 5am and going to the track across the street for a morning run. We're using the C25K app, which we had used about 2 years ago before successfully completing a 5k. We also go for a half mile walk with our kids every day when I get home from work just for some extra exercise and family bonding time. Beyond that, we have both started walking at least a mile during our work day - She walks outside and I walk the perimeter of my office repetitively. This is our current routine.

The first day my legs were jelly. I expected that. The second day I started to get really bad blisters half way through and I decided to call the run quits, immediately deciding I had to get some better shoes. I purchased a pair of Saucony Omni (Good shoes?) as they seemed to fit my arches best and after learning that I ""pronate"" - a word that is entirely new to my vocabulary. I got some blister resistant socks and some leg compressions, too.

We're now 2 weeks in and the C25K training is getting a bit tougher. This morning I felt like I just couldn't do it. I powered through and finished the run, but felt as though my ankles would collapse at any minute. I've heard people in r/GetMotivated say that you shouldn't push your body too hard and to listen to your body and to know your limits. But I wasn't sure if this was my limit, or simply one of those trials in which I needed to push through it to get stronger. I decided on the latter - after all, I didn't want to leave my wife running alone in the dark.

My primary issue 2 years ago as we (mildly) trained for the 5k was my shin splints. Every time I ran it felt like I was so stiff. This time around, however, it is all in my ankles. They burn, they feel tight, and they feel like giving out. Especially the inside of my ankles, which I am sure has something to do with pronating. The shin splints are still there a bit, but nowhere near what they used to be.

I am now sitting in my office and the pain I felt this morning feels like a distant memory, so I know I'm fine - but guys... this sucks. I want so badly to enjoy running and to feel comfortable and excited to wake up at 5am and just make it happen.

I know I'm super early in the game here as it has only been 2 weeks. So maybe the pain I feel is normal. But also, maybe there is something I need to be doing to alleviate the pain that I haven't stumbled upon yet.

So my questions are: Does the pain go away? If so, how long does that take? And finally, if you have any advice to share I'd be more than happy to take it.

Well, last fall my sister gifted me a pair of running shoes because I mentioned I thought picking running back up might help with stress and what not. Started off just doing about a max of three miles about two to three times a week. As the current summer approached, I was doing about five to seven miles every other day. Then comes this morning. I woke up at 6 am and made some coffee while checking the forecast. I live in the Chicago land area and we are having been having really nice running weather in the mornings and evenings this past week (~ mid 60 °F - 70 ° F (15 °C - 21°C)). Today was a nice overcast day with a little rain later. Perfect almost Fall weather! So I popped on some indie folk acoustic to match the fall vibe and started my run. I was planning on only doing seven miles, but when I reached my usual cool down spot, I felt stopping there was a waste of such great weather, so I kept going. By the end of the run, I checked my tracking app and was surprised to see I was at 12.7 miles. I ended up doing my cool down to reach 13.1.

I am M/36, I run 4-5 times a week in the morning, usually 4mi each. I also lift weights and do legs twice a week, including heavy squats on Sundays.

I'm finding a persistent pain and tightness just behind my right hip. Its the kind of muscle that feels like im kind of stretching it if I do crow/crow variations for those who do yoga, or any kind of twist stretch. But none of those stretches have absolved the issue. I have tried foam rolling, which doesn't seem to do anything, or rolling around on a lacrosse ball, which is incredibly painful and also doesn't seem to do it. I've gotten sports massages, I stretch every night, I stretch before and after lifting and before and after running. Ive tried NOT stretching, to see if that was the problem, it was not. 

So I am kind of frustrated and unsure what to do. I took time off running, came back, and its still there. I went to a sports doctor, who sucked and referred me to a physical therapist, who also sucked and just took my money.

Does anyone else have this issue? I recognize it is a result of lifting AND running - my gym was shut down for 3 months during the height of lockdowns and I didn't have the problem too badly anymore. But when my gym reopened and I started back on the weights, it began to flare up. I realized I need to find the right balance with running and lifting, and have indeed stepped back to 4 days a week running with 2 full no-run days after my heavy squat Sunday. But I am basically wondering, with this particular tightness/injury, does anyone have any advice? Any stretches or exercises or whatever?

I realized I need to find the right balance with running and lifting, and have indeed stepped back to 4 days a week running with 2 full no-run days after my heavy squat Sunday. But I am basically wondering, with this particular tightness/injury, does anyone have any advice? Any stretches or exercises or whatever? Especially anyone who also lifts and runs, but anyone who has thoughts I will take them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

Would love for some others to get value out of it. :) The link is:

[Google doc link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tWitQGJVvmBlaRzxftYrxInCXYFbLGZnUg55CxHkug8/copy) 

The sheet tracks my runs so I could better see my progress/set my goals/make sure I wasn’t running too much (currently dealing with shin splints :( 

The progress, graphs, and overload tabs don’t need any input. Just input you runs on the 2,3,4 mile, and Random Runs and the sheets will do the work.

&lt;p&gt;The sheet tracks my runs so I could better see my progress/set my goals/make sure I wasn’t running too much (currently dealing with shin splints :( &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progress, graphs, and overload tabs don’t need any input. Just input you runs on the 2,3,4 mile, and Random Runs and the sheets will do the work.

The workout plan is build as follows:

\* monday - rest\* tuesday - short distance easy run\* wednesday -  rest\* thursday -  tempo hill run\* friday - rest\* saturday - mid distance easy run\* sunday - long distance slow run

I really want to do something on the rest days, in order to both make me feel like I am still working on my goal and something that does not make my body feel like it stiffens up.I am 24 years old, and has always been pretty active and I feel like my body is pretty fast at recovering.I am working a deskjob and goes to school so my time not running is pretty stationary, and if I have a whole day sitting at my desk just standing and doing slight stretches occasionally it sometimes feels like my body stiffens up.

However! I am looking through the internet and it seems like there is a lot of guides both making this seem like a good idea and some straight up contradicting it.So I was looking for some opinions based on personal experiences. If anyone has been in my place or has something relevant on the matter. Then please let me know. :)

&lt;p&gt;The workout plan is build as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* monday - rest* tuesday - short distance easy run* wednesday -  rest* thursday -  tempo hill run* friday - rest* saturday - mid distance easy run* sunday - long distance slow run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to do something on the rest days, in order to both make me feel like I am still working on my goal and something that does not make my body feel like it stiffens up.I am 24 years old, and has always been pretty active and I feel like my body is pretty fast at recovering.I am working a deskjob and goes to school so my time not running is pretty stationary, and if I have a whole day sitting at my desk just standing and doing slight stretches occasionally it sometimes feels like my body stiffens up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However! I am looking through the internet and it seems like there is a lot of guides both making this seem like a good idea and some straight up contradicting it.So I was looking for some opinions based on personal experiences. If anyone has been in my place or has something relevant on the matter. Then please let me know. :)  &lt;/p&gt;

If you&amp;#39;re seeing everyone around you getting more done than you but not feeling as tired, you probably have a fatigue issue. Laziness is rarely JUST laziness, don&amp;#39;t put yourself down if you&amp;#39;re not feeling up to running most of the time, and don&amp;#39;t let anyone tell you it&amp;#39;s all in your head if you can&amp;#39;t seem to pull yourself together on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to know if you have any memorable/regular scenic running routes that any of you have ever done, or if there's any you've encountered on your travels. Pictures, descriptive text, maps links, whichever you prefer, but I'd love to know what some of you have encountered while running and why they're important to you.

Reason why I'm curious is I'm inspired by a run I did last month while backpacking (happy I packed trail shoes!). It was in the Austrian Alps around Lake Fuschl, a 6.8 mile/11km, 615ft./187m elevation, part gravel/part dirt trail which looped around this beautiful blue lake.

What made it different from other runs for me (other than the immense scenery) were the amazing smells in the forest, the complete silence, and the various happy people I encountered along the run. Uphill lung-rippers along the trail were rewarded by rolling downhills to claw your time back. Felt it was a perfectly balanced run from a cardio/legs perspective while also having some of the most amazing and beautiful views I've ever encountered.

[I've uploaded a few pics here (if you're interested)](https://imgur.com/a/EMnDexD), as well as the stats from my run. 

Looking forward to seeing what others have to share! I want to compile a list, map layer if possible.

,running,"Background on me: Male; 37 yo; 185 lb, \~30 MPW @ \~8:30-9:30 w/ intervals @ 7:30, max HR \~192.

I ran my first half-marathon last September and finished in 2:03. My goal for this year was to do sub 2, with a stretch goal of sub1:50. I started the Runner's Weekly 12-week sub 2 hour plan back in June. This included a mix of interval, threshold and long runs. 

Last weekend I ran a [half-marathon TT](https://www.strava.com/activities/3987802591) and achieved my goal of sub 2 hours: 1:53:45, 8:41/mile, 162 avg. HR. At the end I felt fatigued, but I think I had a little more left in the tank. I've seen plenty of numerical advice on pacing (i.e. 10k time x 2 + 10 mins; 10k pace + 20-30 secs). But I haven't been able to find much advice on how I should **feel** at various stages of the race.

For the first couple of miles I was paying close attention to pace so as not to start out too hot. After mile 3 I stopped paying attention to pace as much and started to speed up a bit. I felt really good through mile 8, no fatigue or discomfort. Half way through mile 9 I had to run up a short steep ramp on a dirt trail. This was the first time I really noticed the fatigue in my legs. Beginning around mile 10 I started to notice a dull burning in my legs. They felt a little bit heavier. But I was still able to speed up. This burning continued to increase through to the end, but if you look at my splits I continued speeding up. My last three splits were 8:29, 8:20, 7:59.

To explain the graph, the first 5-10 minutes is where I did a walking warm up (subtracting the walk from the total time means I did the 5k in approximately 40+ min. The walking pace was normal speed, like walking to a mailbox. I wasnt in a hurry at all and you can see my HR is 100+ as I start to run. I then used the following intervals to cover 5k: 60 seconds running, 30 seconds walking. It is important to note that my pace during the running portion is deliberately slow; that pace where any slower and you'll feel silly like you're just bouncing up and down and can walk faster. I'm going to estimate it at about 12+minutes/mile. 

As seen in the chart, after the very first 60 second run interval, I'm already in zone 5, above 167 bpm. Less than half way through the run, my HR is reaching 190 and continues to reach higher at each interval, peaking at 199 BPM at the final intervals. 

I am using a Garmin Forerunner watch, paired with a Garmin HRM chest strap. I've been using them for a few months already through various activities and get consistent readings for my activities. I say this to rule out the idea of a faulty reading on the day I did this 5k. 

I concentrate on my breathing while running and even more so in the walking/ recovery phase and yet I can't keep the HR under control. Is this normal?

Edit 2: So I've been pretty active since the start of Covid here in the US. I do about 3 work outs a week, varying between running, ruck marches, boxing, and cycling. I honestly and baffled at the lack of progress in my cardio over the course of this time. I can't find a way to do anything in zone 3 for more than a few minutes let alone zone 2. My HR just jumps right up. My boxing workouts specifically are HIIT style given the set up with rounds. My cycling is less HIIT than the other exercises and focuses more of cruising and covering distance. The rucks are just me walking 2-3 miles with a 45 lb weight vest.

,running,"Hi everyone,

I've been training for half-marathon (not a real event) for the past 3 months and this Saturday is the big day. The problem is... I live in SoCal and we just got an excessive heat watch from Friday-Monday. The day of my planned half run, it's going to be 75° around 6:45am and will get up to 108° throughout the day. I ALWAYS run in the morning because my runs are very apparently bad when it's hot out. I'm debating if I should just do the half one day before (Friday), which is expected to be a bit cooler at 65° at 6:45 in the morning and getting up to 96° around noon. My only worry about this is that I know the taper is very important for marathon prep and I did my last long run (11 miles) last Saturday.. Whichever day I choose, I plan on running from 6:30am-8:30am. 

Anyway, with all this being said, what option would you all choose?

1. Run one day earlier (Friday) and not have a full taper + might be a bit more tired since Thursday is a long work day. BUT it won't be as hot and heat plays a big role in how well I run.
2. Run on the planned date (Saturday) and in really hot weather. But will have a full taper and may not be as drained from the following work day.

**Background.**

I have recently taken on getting into shape after letting myself go over the years. I am severely overweight and can barely jog at a slow pace for a minute straight. I've genuinely enjoyed my time eating chips on the couch and being a sedentary sloth. However, I'm in dire need of more energy, a better lifestyle, and frankly, not having to worry about the higher risk of collapsing after climbing up a couple flights of stairs.

**What I've done, and what I plan to do.**

tl;dr I started off building up walking at increasingly aggressive paces and distances over the past few weeks. I am now giving a 5k program a shot, and largely walking/fat-man jogging most of the time. I have absolutely no shame severely struggling out there, even when most of the community around me is filled with skilled runners on the trails. I'm doing my thing, and taking it one step at a time. I've noticed the aches and pains associated with running is exponential when you're as large as I am, and when all 300lbs+ are pounding away at the asphalt. I realized my lifestyle New Balances were probably not cutting it. So, I've just pulled the trigger on some highly reviewed Saucony balanced sneakers to hopefully ease some of those pains.

**Questions.**

**1)** What practical recommendations do you have for me? As mentioned before, I'm not really in need of motivation here, but more so tips and techniques you may have for your fellow fat-jogger.I know for a fact that my form isn't great, and it gets sloppier as I get fatigued (really quickly), so I open myself up to injury. This is one area I'm concerned about. I'm also interested in what other's fat loss journey has been, especially those who were once obese. What mistakes can I avoid? How can I ensure I actually stick to this and not give up? Lastly, I'm sure the benefits of running far outweigh the increased impact on the joints over the long term, but this is another area I'm concerned about, as my knees/joints are pretty weak.

**2)** This one sounds like a simple inter-webs search, but I've seriously been struggling trying to find something good - what do other fat-runners recommend for clothing? The sizes for run wear is tailored to the more slim profile, of course, and it's really difficult finding decent dry wick gear for fat people. Any advice is appreciated here. I'm particularly interested in long sleeve and short sleeve t-shirts. I do not prefer wearing only compression shirts, as I don't want my many rolls on public display. :)

**3)** I don't enjoy carrying any extra baggage on me, but am finding that I need water after about \~20mins. How do ya'll go about this?

# The Dipsea Race

People who have been around this sub in its various incarnations for a while are probably aware of my love for The Dipsea. Run every June, it is a truly unique race: Overly simplified, it’s an approximately seven-mile trail run from downtown Mill Valley, California to the Pacific Ocean at Stinson Beach.  But that leaves out the history of the race, and the handicapping, and the shortcuts, and all of the crazy stories that have grown up over the years around the race and its runners.

Let’s start with the basics: If you look at [a map and elevation profile of the trail](https://www.strava.com/activities/2437424221), you’ll see that it starts and ends near sea level and   crosses over two major ridges along the way.  It turns out that in 1904, a couple of runners from San Francisco were vacationing in Stinson Beach and took a day-trip to Mill Valley — which had only recently become possible thanks to a new rail line — and made a bet as to who could get back to their inn on the beach, on foot, the fastest.  They raced (the winner is still in dispute to this day), and a tradition was born.  The next year in 1905, the “Dipsea Indians” (as they named their group, an offshoot of the San Francisco Olympic Club) organized the first official Dipsea Race and the rest has been history.

## The Handicaps

Early on, race organizers decided that they wanted to give anyone a shot at winning the race.  Every runner was given an individual “handicap time”, and those times were even published in the local newspaper before the race.  As the field grew, it became impractical to know the abilities of each individual entrant and the race moved to a handicapping system based off of age and gender.

Only men aged 19-30 (the “fastest” demographic, or “scratch” runners) start at the official start time. Everyone else gets a head start, with the slowest groups starting 25 minutes before the scratch runners.  Under this system, an 8-year-old girl won in 2010 and a 72-year-old man won in 2012.  In any given year, you’ll find 60-somethings and 20-somethings duking it out over the last mile of the course.

Your official time for the race is based off the start time for the scratch runners — so if you run the course in an hour, but you start ten minutes early, you have an official time of 50 minutes. 

## The Stairs

The race starts in downtown Mill Valley but less than a mile up the road you reach the base of the first of three sets of stairs, about 685 total steps, that have you climbing out of Mill Valley.  On any given day you’ll find all sorts of folks hiking or running up or down (or up _and_ down) these stairs, but on race day this is the first bottleneck you’re likely to hit.  Bottlenecks and choke points on the route are a recurring problem that needs to be avoided, outrun, or simply accepted -- hey, sub-threshold rest! -- but they're also where the speedsters will get vocal with cries of ""Stay to the right!"" and ""Passing on the left!""

Later on in the race, runners have to contend with the Steep Ravine steps, this time barreling down steep, twisty, unevenly-placed railroad-tie steps as they simultaneously try to avoid twisting an ankle and diving into the ravine.  Plenty of injuries occur on these steps each year, but faster (and more confident) runners are able to make up tons of time by taking these steps two-, three-, or even four-at-a-time in spots.

## The Shortcuts

For years after its inception, Dipsea was an “open course” race — it was up to racers to determine their best route to Stinson Beach, with the consensus route along the Dipsea Trail serving as a suggestion rather than a mandate.  In the 1970s, restrictions started to be begrudgingly added, and now there are essentially three main shortcuts: 

* “Suicide”: A short scramble down a steep, slippery, dirt-and-gravel hillside that only cuts off about 90 yards of the consensus route
* “The Swoop”: A longer descent down a rutted, vegetation-choked hillside that eliminates about a quarter-mile and one of the most beautiful parts of the trail; but who has time for beauty on race day?
* “The Panoramic Shortcuts”, a series of narrow singletracks that have runners jumping on and off of Highway 1 as it switches back up away from the beach towards the end of the race

This isn’t to say that this is the extent of the short-cutting going on, it’s just that most of the rest of the shortcuts are closely-guarded secrets. If a shortcut has a significant impact on the race results — like one did in 1983, when Ron Rahmer had a strong finish after pioneering a novel route between Mill Valley and Steep Ravine — the new routes are typically quickly regulated out of existence.

## Registration

I saved this for last, because it’s a pain.  Intentionally.

The race itself is limited to 1500 athletes, and the organizers are not shy about wanting to preserve the “local” feel of this historic race.  There are a few ways to get in:

* If you ran the race the previous year and did well enough, you are invited to run the next year
* If you have a convincing enough sob story and/or make a large enough donation to the Dipsea Foundation (an organization that both maintains the trail and also provides scholarships for local students), you can buy your way in.  On the website, they say “YES, we do take bribes!”
* Or you can apply by mail for one of the remaining spots after the invited runners and bribers

If you’re in the last group, the race is on once Dipsea posts the year’s application to their website. They take applicants into the race on a first-come, first-served basis, as determined by when the applications arrive in their post office box at the Mill Valley post office. For a long time local runners have hand-delivered applications to mailing centers to try to earn their spot – first at the Mill Valley Post Office, later to the local USPS sorting center, where I found myself on a lunch break on Application Day in 2017 handing in my first Dipsea registration. 

# My 2020 plan

The Dipsea always comes at something of an odd time in my race calendar, but it remains one of my A-races every year.  I’m a triathlete by nature, but trail running has always been one of my endurance-sport loves; in February I was getting out on dirt and hills at least once a week to prepare.

The plan was to stick to trails at least twice a month, and try to get at least 600 feet in each of those runs.  As I got closer to the race, I was going to spend more time on hill sprints and  mixing in some stair climbs.  I also wanted to get out to Stinson Beach and spend some time working the Steep Ravine descent - knowing exactly how to place my foot each step of the way down that section of trail is one of my long-term goals.  It’s a hefty drive for me, though (90-120 minutes each way, depending on traffic), so I hadn’t actually planned it out completely up to that point.

I had vague plans for a number of specific workouts for Dipsea:

* Two-minute hill sprints at &gt;10% grade, repeated 5-8x
* Tempo runs at 5-8% gradient
* (New for me this year!) _Downhill_ sprints at a -10% grade; I get the impression this is somewhat dangerous, but becoming better at downhilling seems to be the key that will unlock significant improvements in my time — I don’t think I’m particularly slow descending, but I know there’s still a lot of room for improvement there.

This was the general shape of the plan that I came up with during my offseason; these workouts would have to find their way into a schedule that was also trying to prep me for a number of important multisport races along the way.  I work with a coach, and we spent more than a little time discussing these goals and how to try to prioritize and achieve all of them.  I'd be curious to hear if anyone has good recs for steep trail workouts.

On March 13th, the race organization announced that they’d be canceling the race (for the first time since 1945.)  It was the first of my major races for the summer to be canceled, but it wasn’t the last.  Right now, I’m pinning my hopes on the rescheduled Duathlon National Championships to still take place in October, but otherwise I’m just looking forward to next year.

# What’s next

I’m waiting to see what happens with Du Nats in October, and once the results there are definitive (either the race gets canceled, or I actually participate in it) I’m going to look again at what I want to do in February through June of next year for this race.  My entry for this year is supposed to carry over to next year, so I hope to toe the line at the Mill Valley Depot on June 13, 2021.

A couple of notes as I wrap this all up:

* Big thanks to u/Krazyfranco for cutting a thousand words out of my original version of this, and making it infinitely more readable!
* Local legend Barry Spitz has written the definitive guide to the history of the race in a book cleverly titled ""Dipsea"".  It's an awesome book.  Most of what I wrote here was double-checked either on the [race website](https://dipsea.org) or in [Barry's book](http://www.dipseabook.com/).",t2_hn930,False,,0,False,"Requiem for a Race, lap 1: The Dipsea Race [x-post from r/artc]",[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-article,0,,False,t3_ik3gxl,False,dark,0.92,,public,18,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Article,False,18,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598927004.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey folks -- over on &lt;a href=""/r/artc""&gt;r/artc&lt;/a&gt; I was chatting with a bunch of folks about how we all had Big Races and Big Plans that all got blown away by Big Problems in the world over the last few months. I decided to start a little series for people to talk about their big race -- what makes it special, how they were training for it, and what they hope to do next.  This is the first one, and it&amp;#39;s about my favorite race in the world.  I thought it might be of interest to some of the folks over here too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Dipsea Race&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have been around this sub in its various incarnations for a while are probably aware of my love for The Dipsea. Run every June, it is a truly unique race: Overly simplified, it’s an approximately seven-mile trail run from downtown Mill Valley, California to the Pacific Ocean at Stinson Beach.  But that leaves out the history of the race, and the handicapping, and the shortcuts, and all of the crazy stories that have grown up over the years around the race and its runners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics: If you look at &lt;a href=""https://www.strava.com/activities/2437424221""&gt;a map and elevation profile of the trail&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see that it starts and ends near sea level and   crosses over two major ridges along the way.  It turns out that in 1904, a couple of runners from San Francisco were vacationing in Stinson Beach and took a day-trip to Mill Valley — which had only recently become possible thanks to a new rail line — and made a bet as to who could get back to their inn on the beach, on foot, the fastest.  They raced (the winner is still in dispute to this day), and a tradition was born.  The next year in 1905, the “Dipsea Indians” (as they named their group, an offshoot of the San Francisco Olympic Club) organized the first official Dipsea Race and the rest has been history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Handicaps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, race organizers decided that they wanted to give anyone a shot at winning the race.  Every runner was given an individual “handicap time”, and those times were even published in the local newspaper before the race.  As the field grew, it became impractical to know the abilities of each individual entrant and the race moved to a handicapping system based off of age and gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only men aged 19-30 (the “fastest” demographic, or “scratch” runners) start at the official start time. Everyone else gets a head start, with the slowest groups starting 25 minutes before the scratch runners.  Under this system, an 8-year-old girl won in 2010 and a 72-year-old man won in 2012.  In any given year, you’ll find 60-somethings and 20-somethings duking it out over the last mile of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your official time for the race is based off the start time for the scratch runners — so if you run the course in an hour, but you start ten minutes early, you have an official time of 50 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Stairs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race starts in downtown Mill Valley but less than a mile up the road you reach the base of the first of three sets of stairs, about 685 total steps, that have you climbing out of Mill Valley.  On any given day you’ll find all sorts of folks hiking or running up or down (or up &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; down) these stairs, but on race day this is the first bottleneck you’re likely to hit.  Bottlenecks and choke points on the route are a recurring problem that needs to be avoided, outrun, or simply accepted -- hey, sub-threshold rest! -- but they&amp;#39;re also where the speedsters will get vocal with cries of &amp;quot;Stay to the right!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Passing on the left!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on in the race, runners have to contend with the Steep Ravine steps, this time barreling down steep, twisty, unevenly-placed railroad-tie steps as they simultaneously try to avoid twisting an ankle and diving into the ravine.  Plenty of injuries occur on these steps each year, but faster (and more confident) runners are able to make up tons of time by taking these steps two-, three-, or even four-at-a-time in spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years after its inception, Dipsea was an “open course” race — it was up to racers to determine their best route to Stinson Beach, with the consensus route along the Dipsea Trail serving as a suggestion rather than a mandate.  In the 1970s, restrictions started to be begrudgingly added, and now there are essentially three main shortcuts: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Suicide”: A short scramble down a steep, slippery, dirt-and-gravel hillside that only cuts off about 90 yards of the consensus route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The Swoop”: A longer descent down a rutted, vegetation-choked hillside that eliminates about a quarter-mile and one of the most beautiful parts of the trail; but who has time for beauty on race day?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The Panoramic Shortcuts”, a series of narrow singletracks that have runners jumping on and off of Highway 1 as it switches back up away from the beach towards the end of the race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say that this is the extent of the short-cutting going on, it’s just that most of the rest of the shortcuts are closely-guarded secrets. If a shortcut has a significant impact on the race results — like one did in 1983, when Ron Rahmer had a strong finish after pioneering a novel route between Mill Valley and Steep Ravine — the new routes are typically quickly regulated out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Registration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saved this for last, because it’s a pain.  Intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race itself is limited to 1500 athletes, and the organizers are not shy about wanting to preserve the “local” feel of this historic race.  There are a few ways to get in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you ran the race the previous year and did well enough, you are invited to run the next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a convincing enough sob story and/or make a large enough donation to the Dipsea Foundation (an organization that both maintains the trail and also provides scholarships for local students), you can buy your way in.  On the website, they say “YES, we do take bribes!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or you can apply by mail for one of the remaining spots after the invited runners and bribers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the last group, the race is on once Dipsea posts the year’s application to their website. They take applicants into the race on a first-come, first-served basis, as determined by when the applications arrive in their post office box at the Mill Valley post office. For a long time local runners have hand-delivered applications to mailing centers to try to earn their spot – first at the Mill Valley Post Office, later to the local USPS sorting center, where I found myself on a lunch break on Application Day in 2017 handing in my first Dipsea registration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My 2020 plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dipsea always comes at something of an odd time in my race calendar, but it remains one of my A-races every year.  I’m a triathlete by nature, but trail running has always been one of my endurance-sport loves; in February I was getting out on dirt and hills at least once a week to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to stick to trails at least twice a month, and try to get at least 600 feet in each of those runs.  As I got closer to the race, I was going to spend more time on hill sprints and  mixing in some stair climbs.  I also wanted to get out to Stinson Beach and spend some time working the Steep Ravine descent - knowing exactly how to place my foot each step of the way down that section of trail is one of my long-term goals.  It’s a hefty drive for me, though (90-120 minutes each way, depending on traffic), so I hadn’t actually planned it out completely up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had vague plans for a number of specific workouts for Dipsea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two-minute hill sprints at &amp;gt;10% grade, repeated 5-8x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tempo runs at 5-8% gradient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(New for me this year!) &lt;em&gt;Downhill&lt;/em&gt; sprints at a -10% grade; I get the impression this is somewhat dangerous, but becoming better at downhilling seems to be the key that will unlock significant improvements in my time — I don’t think I’m particularly slow descending, but I know there’s still a lot of room for improvement there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the general shape of the plan that I came up with during my offseason; these workouts would have to find their way into a schedule that was also trying to prep me for a number of important multisport races along the way.  I work with a coach, and we spent more than a little time discussing these goals and how to try to prioritize and achieve all of them.  I&amp;#39;d be curious to hear if anyone has good recs for steep trail workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the first of my major races for the summer to be canceled, but it wasn’t the last.  Right now, I’m pinning my hopes on the rescheduled Duathlon National Championships to still take place in October, but otherwise I’m just looking forward to next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What’s next&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m waiting to see what happens with Du Nats in October, and once the results there are definitive (either the race gets canceled, or I actually participate in it) I’m going to look again at what I want to do in February through June of next year for this race.

,running,"Hey everyone, posting for the first time here. (28yo male, 83kg)

I chose this race because I wanted to try something shorter for my first race. I started running this year and only just started running 4-6 times a week like two months ago. I usually run 3-8km each run and I also started training with HRM with chest strap. I also have quite a bit of cycling in last 6 years but running is totally new for me.

Anyway there was this local race which had 3,7 and 8,4km course. I signed for the shorter one and was thinking that I would keep my HR around 160-165 (28yo). Well that didn't really work as well as I expected. When we were waiting for the start and the countdown started I felt rush of adrenaline and my HR was already at 140. 

As soon as everyone started running I realized that there are only two options 

A: Keep HR in a reasonable range and let everyone run away or 

B: Just see for how long I can keep up with everyone and hope I will not get heart attack or something. 

After first few hundred meters I was already at 190 and there was just no way I could keep this up for the rest of the race, but to my surprise I did and set my new PRs in that race. I checked my HRM during the race a few times and even saw 205 there once. 

There were just 5 of us running the short race and about 50 people on the long one but it felt good to keep pace with them for a while. 

I never even realized it would be possible to keep this pace but being in the race kept me going even after I thought I would not be able to run. It was amazing feeling when I went through the finish line and realized that this was probably the hardest 16 minutes of my life (at least physicaly). I also realized that there will be way more of those efforst because I wanted to be even faster on my next race. I think I just became obsessed with improving myself.

,running,"Hello,

 Yesterday I  attempted to run my first 42.2 km by doing 12 laps of the neiborhood in front of my house. Grabbing Gatorade every pass. (gummies and banana in alternate as well). Result: 3h 51m

I'm 48M, been a casual runner since age 40. Some years almost no running because of injuries.

But last winter I began training to run a marathon (having done 1/2s before).  I did some stairs training approx 100 floors 3-4 times a week. Then with the lockdown, I started running outside, approx 700 km during the spring and summer. Mixing speed, lengths and intervals in there. 3 long runs (27km, 27km, 30km)

Yesterday, my pace was a bit below 5:20 for the first 30km. A confortable speed for me. But for the last 10km, I couldn't keep it, It became so painful. My calfs were contracted constantly and very painful, achilles and thigh muscle as well. I never stopped but my pace was almost 1 minute slower at that point. My heart rate was in the 155 the whole time, never out of breath.

My question is this: Is this normal ? Was that what they call ""the wall"" ?  Are there ways that I could go the full 42kms without this pain ? Because Up until that moment, I was thinking it was very enjoyable, I would have liked to run it with other people but the last 10 kms I was telling myself never to attempt this ever again.

### Background &amp; Training

As is probably true for many of you reading this, 2020's sucked for me pretty hard. In addition to the global pandemic affecting us all, my city (Chicago)'s been dealing with police brutality and its resulting civic unrest, and also hosted an unwelcome tornado a few weeks ago. On top of all that, personally I've been dealing with a pandemic breakup and being diagnosed with HPV (baby's first STI). It's been a fun time, and by fun I mean absolutely terrible. So when I read about [this challenge on r/advanced running](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/ibgxol/6121824_challenge_experience/) I thought, why the hell not? I'll see how doable something dumb like this is for someone of my age, gender, and general stormcloud temperament, and have something to think about for a little while that isn't simply the crushing despair of being alive.

Before the pandemic came to the U.S., I was training for a spring marathon using a modified Hanson plan (longer long runs), hoping to get under 4 hours after a 4:04 attempt last fall (which itself had improved upon a previous 4:31 best). Since that race was cancelled in March, I've mostly repeated the week of the training plan I was in when I got the news. It includes one interval day (usually 12x400m), one should-be-tempo day (that I've mostly run easy instead because \*gestures to world\*), a long run of 16-20 miles, and two easy 7-8 milers, which all shakes out to 60-65 miles/week. Every 4th week, I do a step back and go down to about 30 miles instead.

To prepare for this particular effort, I abstained from masturbating after Friday 8/21, and resumed eating a dessert every day (which isn't unusual for me, but I'd stopped doing because of sadness-induced appetite loss after the breakup). Running-wise, I cut down my Wednesday-Friday runs by a mile or two. ([Supplies ready a week ahead of time](https://imgur.com/VOTbIL6))

### Targets

I don't consider myself a fast runner even under ideal conditions. I've also learned that, for me, sub-9:00/mile paces require a zest for life I no longer possess. So I didn't really care about paces or time targets for this challenge, although I thought it would be nice to accomplish these goals between waking up and going to sleep that night.

So for those who didn't visit the link above to learn what the 6/12/18/24 challenge (aka the Multiples of six challenge) is all about, it's to assign each of those numbers, however you choose, to the following list of activities and then try to accomplish everything within a 24 hour period (less if you can):

* Running a mile
* Masturbating to orgasm
* Eating a donut
* Drinking a beer (note: I subbed hard seltzer because beer is ugh)

It was clear from the get-go that I was going to run 24 miles and eat 18 donuts, but I decided to give myself day-of flexibility on the other two assignments. I'm not a big drinker. The last time I had alcohol prior to this challenge was the day of my breakup, where I chugged a bottle of wine and then spent hours weeping on the public way before eventually vomiting multiple times in my home. But my previous orgasm record in a day was 4, and it didn't seem like a great time to give myself any more sexual aversions than I already have. So I just decided to go by feel that day and see how it went.

### Route

I planned to split the run portion of the challenge into 3 segments: 1 18-mile run that follows my standard long run route, and 2 3-mile runs.

The lakefront is the go-to running trail here, but since it was closed earlier in quarantine I've gotten used to doing my long runs on the North Branch trail (and trails that connect to it). One of those variants takes me by an ex's house right around the 9-mile midpoint, and I arranged to use their porch as a contactless aid station. I didn't pre-plan the 3-mile runs because, who cares, they're 3 milers (no offense intended to anyone for whom that is a substantial distance, I'm just used to longer routes).

### ""Race"" report

#### Session 1

Wake up to my alarm at 4:30am. My hope for some sexy dreams had not come to fruition, but I start the stopwatch on my phone and think of England anyway, making sure to use a very light touch. I come three times before getting out of bed to eat 2 chocolate donuts and drink a ruby red grapefruit white claw (a balanced breakfast).

I put a cherry bon viv into my handheld water bottle and top it up with water, put another donut in a sandwich bag to take along, then hit the road at 5:50am with Spotify's Guilty Pleasures playlist in my ears. ([Setting out](https://imgur.com/7QFN3HV))

##### Miles 1-9.3 (First 15k) | [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/3981595537)

I immediately run into trouble with the seltzer’s carbonation in my water bottle. Shaking the bottle as I ran was creating enough pressure to make the seltzer/water mix shoot out of the bite valve every couple minutes. To prevent this, I have to drink enough of it so it has room to foam, which immediately makes me feel a little queasy, but I continue on at an easy pace, burping all the way.

At mile 3.1/5k I encounter a guy on a bike stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, hunched over and swaying slightly like he was trying hard to stay upright. I feel sympathy for him and hope he isn't a harbinger of what this adventure will bring me, but keep on. (In a big city, you mind your own business unless someone is visibly bleeding or actually asks for help.)

Miles 3.5-7 are blissfully free of incidents and most thoughts. The North branch, Saganaush, and Skokie valley trails are all pretty sparsely populated at this time. I don't get runner's high, but sometimes my thinking pauses for a bit as I run, and the break is fabulous.

At mile 7.3 I pull the donut out of my flipbelt and find that it has been crushed into crumbs that, because the donut is chocolate frosted, bear an uncanny resemblance to dog poop. I avoid eye contact with passing cyclists as I eat it anyway, and am glad that my aid station donuts were plain and powdered. ([Chocolate on my face](https://imgur.com/M2XDn64))

My aid station at mile 9.3 is left outside for me in a cooler: a lime white claw, two plain donuts, and one powdered. The lime flavor is ok, and I pour it into my handheld bottle and continue on.

##### Miles 9.3-18.6 (2nd 15k) | [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/3982126156)

At the aid station, I realized I needed to pee, which wasn't part of the deal but something I should have anticipated due to drinking more than usual on the run.

I end up using a portable toilet on the Channel/Sculpture trail, mentally screaming inside about both covid risk and general port-o-potty foulness the whole time. When I pull my shorts down, they are completely soaked in sweat. I promise myself to stop using my hands to wipe sweat off my face, and not to drink from my bottle spout anymore because *it could have touched something in there*.

Less than 15 minutes later, my concerns have faded and I'm drinking and sweating just like before. I vaguely remember again when I eat the donuts, and make sure to not to touch the donuts with my hands as I eat them out of their bag.

I get home, eat 3 more chocolate donuts and drink a cup of water because the donuts feel SO DRY in my mouth. I open a can of each of the seltzer flavors I haven't tried yet and put them back in the fridge, hoping they'll go a little flatter and thus become more palatable. I drink another cup of sweet, sweet water.

Realizing this is probably as sober as I'm going to be until this is all over, I masturbate again and come 3 more times, my ears ringing afterward. I take a mango bon viv into the shower with me, and the more of it I drink, the worse it tastes. I want more water so much that I imagine opening my mouth under the showerhead, not really caring that the water's warm.

[Session 1 video recap](https://imgur.com/U5eL4Pk)


#### Session 2

I eat 3 more chocolate donuts and drink another glorious cup of water, then head out for another run.

##### Miles 18.6-21.7 (5k) | [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/3982955576)

I try to speed up this run because it's hot and bright out, and because I don't want to put sunscreen on. I listen to a custom playlist of mine that I've titled ""Speed demon"" (speed's all relative) and the run itself is pretty uneventful. ([Warm tho](https://imgur.com/JQla3Fc))

I get home and drink more water, and notice chafing from my earlier run when sweat drips onto areas of my body that it turns out are raw. I'm running out of hooks to hang all my wet clothes on at this point.
I try another masturbation session, come two times but have trouble with #3. I get there eventually with patience and an extremely taboo mental scenario, then celebrate with several more donuts. I realize I've lost count of the donuts I've eaten at this point, and have to count the ones that are left intead. I start drinking a raspberry white claw, which is maybe an ok flavor and maybe just better because it's flatter. At this point I am starting to reconsider all my life choices that led me here, but the end seems so close. I finish the seltzer and take a nap.

#### Session 3

##### Miles 21.7-24.8 (5k) | [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/3983575624)

The end's in sight. I put on fresh running clothes for the last 3 miles (5k) and Spotify's Throwback Workout playlist on shuffle. All my muscles stiffened up during my sublime nap, but they begin to loosen back up after the first mile. I follow the shade and avoid humans, and soon my mileage is complete. ([Smile 'cause it happened, smile 'cause it will be done soon](https://imgur.com/FAk8KEv))

When I get home I drink another cup of magnificent water then wrap up the donut goal too, finishing with one powdered and one plain donut. I never even touched the packs of mini donuts. Turns out one of them expired in June.

I chug another half cup of water just because I desperately want it, then set upon the final two goals. Feeling uninspired for self-love, I check out the passionx subreddit (which I used to like), but everything I see on the front page disgusts me now. I return to my imagination, thinking of a less taboo scenario but in far more detail than I'm used to, and come twice more. I try a bit for #3 (aka #12) when my hand cramps up, so I head to the shower along with a cherry white claw.

The showerhead makes me come for the last time, and the feeling is no longer pleasant, but it is done so the satisfaction comes from that. Still in the shower, I open the stopwatch app on my phone as I choke the last drink down, finishing the seltzer and the challenge in 11:00:11.56.

#### Totals
24.8 miles (40km), 18 donuts, 12 orgasms, 6 alcohols

### Lessons Learned

This is dumb, don't do it. But if you do, keep carbonation in mind, and be prepared to complement your own life goals outside of the challenge as much as you can. If I'd had 12 drinks, I would've gotten drunk and sick, and likely have caused myself some social embarrassment by getting all sloppy and sad about my solitude. Instead, after this exhausting run of self-debauchery I am disgusted by the idea of touching myself again, let alone wanting anyone else to touch me. *Perfect* for an isolated single person during a pandemic.

Next week's another ""scheduled"" stepback running week, so I can use my extra running recovery time to also recover from the varied forms of self-abuse I engaged in as part of this challenge. I'm currently only 1.8 miles away from 2020 miles run in 2020, so reaching that milestone will be nice.

### Kudos

Many thanks go to my support team. I've stopped talking to all my real friends as a result of my in-progress emotional breakdown, but in their place I have assembled a patchwork configuration of ad-hoc support that I think of, in a Blanche DuBois-channeling way, as ""the kindness of strangers."" I appreciated the help of these exes and tinder chat buddies (while acknowledging that they are obviously humoring me for their own selfish reasons), including:

* The ex who let me use their porch as an aid station
* The tinder bae who, after hearing how I was discouraged by the trauma-causing ex, said ""Why are you trying to assemble a support team anyway? The original guy didn't mention any of that""
* The ex who, when I became disheartened about attempting this due to the trauma-causing ex expressing disapproval and refusing to help, said ""[Eff] him""
* The tinder bae who assured me that I don't need ""validation from an overkill challenge"" but also offered to ""fight [their] way through whatever configuration"" with me if I wanted a partner. (looool... Reader, obviously I did not)

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Background &amp;amp; Training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is probably true for many of you reading this, 2020&amp;#39;s sucked for me pretty hard. In addition to the global pandemic affecting us all, my city (Chicago)&amp;#39;s been dealing with police brutality and its resulting civic unrest, and also hosted an unwelcome tornado a few weeks ago. On top of all that, personally I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with a pandemic breakup and being diagnosed with HPV (baby&amp;#39;s first STI). It&amp;#39;s been a fun time, and by fun I mean absolutely terrible. So when I read about &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/ibgxol/6121824_challenge_experience/""&gt;this challenge on r/advanced running&lt;/a&gt; I thought, why the hell not? I&amp;#39;ll see how doable something dumb like this is for someone of my age, gender, and general stormcloud temperament, and have something to think about for a little while that isn&amp;#39;t simply the crushing despair of being alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic came to the U.S., I was training for a spring marathon using a modified Hanson plan (longer long runs), hoping to get under 4 hours after a 4:04 attempt last fall (which itself had improved upon a previous 4:31 best). Since that race was cancelled in March, I&amp;#39;ve mostly repeated the week of the training plan I was in when I got the news. It includes one interval day (usually 12x400m), one should-be-tempo day (that I&amp;#39;ve mostly run easy instead because *gestures to world*), a long run of 16-20 miles, and two easy 7-8 milers, which all shakes out to 60-65 miles/week. Every 4th week, I do a step back and go down to about 30 miles instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prepare for this particular effort, I abstained from masturbating after Friday 8/21, and resumed eating a dessert every day (which isn&amp;#39;t unusual for me, but I&amp;#39;d stopped doing because of sadness-induced appetite loss after the breakup). Running-wise, I cut down my Wednesday-Friday runs by a mile or two. (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/VOTbIL6""&gt;Supplies ready a week ahead of time&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Targets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t consider myself a fast runner even under ideal conditions. I&amp;#39;ve also learned that, for me, sub-9:00/mile paces require a zest for life I no longer possess. So I didn&amp;#39;t really care about paces or time targets for this challenge, although I thought it would be nice to accomplish these goals between waking up and going to sleep that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for those who didn&amp;#39;t visit the link above to learn what the 6/12/18/24 challenge (aka the Multiples of six challenge) is all about, it&amp;#39;s to assign each of those numbers, however you choose, to the following list of activities and then try to accomplish everything within a 24 hour period (less if you can):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running a mile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Masturbating to orgasm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating a donut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking a beer (note: I subbed hard seltzer because beer is ugh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear from the get-go that I was going to run 24 miles and eat 18 donuts, but I decided to give myself day-of flexibility on the other two assignments. I&amp;#39;m not a big drinker. The last time I had alcohol prior to this challenge was the day of my breakup, where I chugged a bottle of wine and then spent hours weeping on the public way before eventually vomiting multiple times in my home. But my previous orgasm record in a day was 4, and it didn&amp;#39;t seem like a great time to give myself any more sexual aversions than I already have. So I just decided to go by feel that day and see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Route&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to split the run portion of the challenge into 3 segments: 1 18-mile run that follows my standard long run route, and 2 3-mile runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lakefront is the go-to running trail here, but since it was closed earlier in quarantine I&amp;#39;ve gotten used to doing my long runs on the North Branch trail (and trails that connect to it). One of those variants takes me by an ex&amp;#39;s house right around the 9-mile midpoint, and I arranged to use their porch as a contactless aid station. I didn&amp;#39;t pre-plan the 3-mile runs because, who cares, they&amp;#39;re 3 milers (no offense intended to anyone for whom that is a substantial distance, I&amp;#39;m just used to longer routes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;Race&amp;quot; report&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Session 1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wake up to my alarm at 4:30am. My hope for some sexy dreams had not come to fruition, but I start the stopwatch on my phone and think of England anyway, making sure to use a very light touch. I come three times before getting out of bed to eat 2 chocolate donuts and drink a ruby red grapefruit white claw (a balanced breakfast).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put a cherry bon viv into my handheld water bottle and top it up with water, put another donut in a sandwich bag to take along, then hit the road at 5:50am with Spotify&amp;#39;s Guilty Pleasures playlist in my ears. (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/7QFN3HV""&gt;Setting out&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Miles 1-9.3 (First 15k) | &lt;a href=""https://www.strava.com/activities/3981595537""&gt;Strava activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately run into trouble with the seltzer’s carbonation in my water bottle. Shaking the bottle as I ran was creating enough pressure to make the seltzer/water mix shoot out of the bite valve every couple minutes. To prevent this, I have to drink enough of it so it has room to foam, which immediately makes me feel a little queasy, but I continue on at an easy pace, burping all the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At mile 3.1/5k I encounter a guy on a bike stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, hunched over and swaying slightly like he was trying hard to stay upright. I feel sympathy for him and hope he isn&amp;#39;t a harbinger of what this adventure will bring me, but keep on. (In a big city, you mind your own business unless someone is visibly bleeding or actually asks for help.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miles 3.5-7 are blissfully free of incidents and most thoughts. The North branch, Saganaush, and Skokie valley trails are all pretty sparsely populated at this time. I don&amp;#39;t get runner&amp;#39;s high, but sometimes my thinking pauses for a bit as I run, and the break is fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At mile 7.3 I pull the donut out of my flipbelt and find that it has been crushed into crumbs that, because the donut is chocolate frosted, bear an uncanny resemblance to dog poop. I avoid eye contact with passing cyclists as I eat it anyway, and am glad that my aid station donuts were plain and powdered. (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/M2XDn64""&gt;Chocolate on my face&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aid station at mile 9.3 is left outside for me in a cooler: a lime white claw, two plain donuts, and one powdered. The lime flavor is ok, and I pour it into my handheld bottle and continue on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Miles 9.3-18.6 (2nd 15k) | &lt;a href=""https://www.strava.com/activities/3982126156""&gt;Strava activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the aid station, I realized I needed to pee, which wasn&amp;#39;t part of the deal but something I should have anticipated due to drinking more than usual on the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end up using a portable toilet on the Channel/Sculpture trail, mentally screaming inside about both covid risk and general port-o-potty foulness the whole time. When I pull my shorts down, they are completely soaked in sweat. I promise myself to stop using my hands to wipe sweat off my face, and not to drink from my bottle spout anymore because &lt;em&gt;it could have touched something in there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 15 minutes later, my concerns have faded and I&amp;#39;m drinking and sweating just like before. I vaguely remember again when I eat the donuts, and make sure to not to touch the donuts with my hands as I eat them out of their bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get home, eat 3 more chocolate donuts and drink a cup of water because the donuts feel SO DRY in my mouth. I open a can of each of the seltzer flavors I haven&amp;#39;t tried yet and put them back in the fridge, hoping they&amp;#39;ll go a little flatter and thus become more palatable. I drink another cup of sweet, sweet water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing this is probably as sober as I&amp;#39;m going to be until this is all over, I masturbate again and come 3 more times, my ears ringing afterward. I take a mango bon viv into the shower with me, and the more of it I drink, the worse it tastes. I want more water so much that I imagine opening my mouth under the showerhead, not really caring that the water&amp;#39;s warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/U5eL4Pk""&gt;Session 1 video recap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Session 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat 3 more chocolate donuts and drink another glorious cup of water, then head out for another run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Miles 18.6-21.7 (5k) | &lt;a href=""https://www.strava.com/activities/3982955576""&gt;Strava activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to speed up this run because it&amp;#39;s hot and bright out, and because I don&amp;#39;t want to put sunscreen on. I listen to a custom playlist of mine that I&amp;#39;ve titled &amp;quot;Speed demon&amp;quot; (speed&amp;#39;s all relative) and the run itself is pretty uneventful. (&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/JQla3Fc""&gt;Warm tho&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end&amp;#39;s in sight. I put on fresh running clothes for the last 3 miles (5k) and Spotify&amp;#39;s Throwback Workout playlist on shuffle. All my muscles stiffened up during my sublime nap, but they begin to loosen back up after the first mile. I follow the shade and avoid humans, and soon my mileage is complete.

,running,"Hello, 

I am wondering if you have advice on how to improve my recovery time from longer runs, and or whether there are some hard and fast rules. 

I am male, 37, 5'7 and weigh 169 lbs. I am fairly athletic, but could still stand to loose a few pounds. I generally run 4-5 times per week, a couple on the treadmill during HIIT workouts, a couple 4-5 km runs w/ hills, and usually a longer one on Sundays (10-16 km w/ the occasional half). My 15 km plus pace is usually around 5:30/km, and my 5km pace is just under 5:00/km. I'm no Mo Farah.

The days after my longer runs by body feels like it needs a rest, especially around the hips / glutes. At the same time, I see folks I see out running all the time on Strava, and they are crushing longer distances all the time, day in and day out. Mentally I am there (and really want to do more, its saving my mental health during the pandemic), but clearly need to improve my recovery routine. 

I know we are not meant to seek medical advice, so more asking what has worked for you. The web brings up things I do, like stretching, sleep, and foam rolling. I know this. 

Is the answer that everyone is different, or these folks are just better conditioned? Or are there other things you good folks of Reddit would recommend to assist with recovery so I can get back our sooner, and go harder.

### Training
I am a 24 yo male and have started running in the beginning of the year. Took march, april and may off because I was hoping Covid-19 would be over soon and I would be able to resume training normally (lol). Came back in the end of may and started Hal Higdon’s Novice 2 half marathon plan. It was a really good training program, started slow and easy and gradually built up the mileage throughout the 12 weeks. In the middle of my journey I hit a road block where I would just stop running before I was tired or hurt. I just could not finish a workout, no matter how short it was. It went on for about a week and I made a post here at reddit that really helped me. I got back on track and crushed all my sessions after I finally overcame this mental block. I had never run farther than 10 km before this plan and, in this month alone, i ran 15 km, 17 km, 19 km and 21 km. Really happy with my overall progress as I did not skip a single workout. The only thing I would change is I think I should have accepted sooner that running slower in training is the way to go. You just have got to do it to get fitter and faster. 

### Race strategy
I was fairly confident that I could finish the race, as I had done 19 km 2 weeks ago, so I decided to set a time limit goal. I used an online pace calculator that, based on my 10 km recent time, said I should run at about 5:14 min/km. Thus, my goal was set on finishing below 1:50:00. Decided to have a sip of water at 5 km and  15 km, a sip of gatorade at 10 km and 18 km and a GU gel at 7 km and 14 km. Hydration is kinda of annoying with a facemask, but not that big of a deal.

### Pre-race
Nothing major. Had a big pasta lunch at noon and a few cookies an hour before racing (started at 19:15). Made sure to drink lots of water throughout the day and that was pretty much it.

### Race
I took it fairly slow after a couple warm up kms and just got into a comfortable pace for the biggest part of it. Felt really good up until about 10 km when a pain in my right hamstring popped up. I had never felt this before and immediately thought I was done. Pushed through it and luckily after about 3 kms, the pain was gone. Just cruised through the race up until 18 km when I realized I felt much better than anticipated for this point in the race. Decided to pick up the pace and kinda flew (for my standards at least) towards the finish line. I even had my fastest pace at the last km (4:33 is close to my 5 km race pace lol). 

### Post-race
Amazing feeling of pure joy and accomplishment. Both my parents are half-marathoners and I never could fathom how they could run so far. I was fit, but never imagined I could do it. I was just ecstatic that I got it and beat all my goals. Besides that, got a few blisters at my pinkies and my big toe, but nothing major lol. Also, didn’t really fell that tired, could probably go another 10 km if I didn’t accelerate towards the end.

### What's next?
I have been bit by the endurance bug, not going to lie. I hope to keep doing this for the rest of my life. Love this sport, how it makes me feel and what it makes me think I can do. I graduate from college next year and there is a pretty popular track competition for medicine students in my area. Hope to compete in the 6 km and, maybe, in the 800m. To win the 6 km I need to hit about a 3:45 min/km pace, so that is a goal for about a year from now. For the immediate future, I think I’ll get on another half marathon program and try to crush 1:45:00. Above all else, I just want to keep running, keep getting better and keep believing in myself.

Above all else, I just want to keep running, keep getting better and keep believing in myself. &lt;/p&gt;

With the temperature finally starting to drop after a few very hot months, I decided to attempt my second half marathon on Monday. My first 21k run was about a month and a half ago. This time, I actually ran further, and finished 25k in 2:26:02.

Then on Wednesday I went on what was supposed to be a 5k recovery run with my flatmate. We finished the first 5k with a 5:32 avg pace, but I was feeling good so I kept going for 5 more k. Finished 10.34k in 51:36, and the last 5k smashed my previous 5k PR, with a total time of 22:43.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve become absolutely obsessed with running, all I want is to go on official races, and I&amp;#39;m happy that for the first time in my life I found a hobby I really like and have done consistently for an extended period so far. I can&amp;#39;t imagine my life without running now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now heading off for one last 5k run this week. Once I finish, it will be my first time running a total of 50k in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

Asking because I've made improvements in my running but not big enough to see this difference, if there is one at all. I first started running at about 7:45+/km. It was hard for me to run even a 6:45/km back then. In my most recent race on a hilly terrain I managed a 6:02/km half marathon. Yet when I'm having my ""easy"" runs, I can easily fall back into a 7+ minute kilometer if I'm not paying attention to my pace.

I know easy runs aren't about time but sometimes when someone asks me what my easy pace is, I don't know whether to report 6:30 OR 7:30/km. Both are easy, conversational paces for me. But if I zone out, I slow down immediately. So I'm wondering if this is a physical or mental thing?

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that I&amp;#39;ve started hating it a little bit again. I enjoyed the interval running up until week 7, but since I&amp;#39;ve had to run 25+ minutes in a row without breaks, I just don&amp;#39;t find any joy in running anymore. I hoped I&amp;#39;d get acclimatised, but it&amp;#39;s been two weeks and I have to drag myself out of the house every single time. It&amp;#39;s mentally quite challenging and I worry about how long I will continue running after the program because it&amp;#39;s no fun anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any advice on how to rediscover the joy in running? I&amp;#39;ve done so much work to get to my current level and I really don&amp;#39;t want to hate it, but I do right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips would be highly appreciated, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

However, it is the first time I was able to break a mental barrier. Prior to today, the longest I have been able to run is 10 miles. Something about the 9th and 10th mile just made me want to stop. I ran 4 10 mile runs just trying to build up and my brain and or my body just wanted to quit.


Today as I was running that dreaded 9th mile I decided to let go of the time expectation and remembered I can always improve my time but I have to do it for the first time. So when my body said stop I walked for 5 minutes and then ran again. Then walked and ran until I finished.


It was important for me to remember that I was doing this for me. Running has always been a mix of a mental and physical challenge for me and this was the next level of the challenge. Officially leveled up!

I then found a mobile phone number linked to the company but they say it's no longer associated with the company.

Perth is currently free of community transmission of COVID, so we are lucky enough to have had almost all our restrictions eased. So, yes, this is an actual race with actual other people! I’d decided at the end of last year while recovering from a foot blister the size of my nose (I am not kidding, PM for pictures) that I wanted to do more races in 2020. As you can imagine, that idea has been going... not well :(

This is to my knowledge the first race in the city since lockdown ended.

### Training
I run around 45km/week, with a bare minimum of 40km (weather and life permitting). I’ve been consistent since February, except I missed a week a month ago due to an injury from stretching at my desk at work, of all things (getting old sucks; I don’t recommend it). My long runs are usually 16-17k. Last year, before the aforementioned blister, I was doing much the same. During lockdown I was doing up to 55km/week, but since returning to work I’ve had to bring my numbers back down. I PB’d 12k in May at the same location (55:16) on the date of a cancelled fun run.

 This race sort of rushed up on me, so I didn’t do much specific for it – I just changed a couple of runs to tempo and changed a long run to fartleks in the weeks before, and then tapered with a tempo 7k and a couple of slow 10s. But it is a super flat course, so I knew that, goal of doing more races or not, if ever there was a race to try to smash, this was it.

### Race strategy
This was my first race over 12k, so I didn't really know what to do, I just knew I didn't want to fail my goal. So my baseline strategy was very conservative - go evenly around 5min/km and then see how much I can push the last 5. I had also decided beforehand though that it was okay to do a 1km fartlek every 3-4km in order to catch up any lost time, but only if I was running over and feeling okay. But that plan turned out to be terrible, so I threw it out after 2km.

I’ve tried a few nutrition approaches, but lack of availability of my favourite – a particular type of fruit mince pies only available at Christmas – meant that for this I settled on the old standby of snake jelly candies. I went for Natural Confection Company, for those Australians reading ;) Honestly, for a race I'd probably just do the same again next time, but I still prefer the fruit mince for a solo run.

### Pre-race
I got up at 5 and started my morning with a cup of green tea and a large cinnamon twist. Hydrated a lot, stretched a little at home, and drove to the lake for an 8am start. It was a little chilly, but the sun was out, so I found a sunny spot to stretch and keep warm. I chatted to a few random people but none were around my pace; there were pacers for the marathon event, but not the half (despite the half being by far the largest event), so there was no way to see who was going to be around my target pace. I listened to the safety brief, dashed off for a last-minute slash, and got back just in time for the countdown!

Incidentally, I saw the pacers on the course, obviously, and there was one guy using the 3 hour pacer, and that's it. Kind of a waste of effort having them, really.

The course is almost exactly a 6km loop run anti-clockwise on a two lane dual use cyclepath around the lake, so the first 1.55 is run clockwise, and then you're back on the loop proper to get back to the start, and then three laps of the lake. I had kinda assumed it would be three laps and then some extra, so this was actually going to mess with my nutrition and water plans a little, but I wasn't too worried about that. 

### Kilometers 1 to 5
At the go, we all started shuffling and moving. The ""out"" part the out and back had a lot of traffic to pass; the field was a little slower than I expected, and I found myself ducking and weaving a lot, and using the opposite lane when I could do so without dodging marathoners coming in the opposite direction. My first km was in the 4:30s.

By the turnaround I'd settled into a group of three others - an older guy, and what I thought were a couple. The older guy said he was aiming for 1:45, so I knew I was in the right group. He identified another guy further ahead - a taller older guy - and said that he had the same aim but was a little faster. We were soon joined by a fifth, a young, tall bald guy. Together the five of us ran in the low 4:50s - faster than my plan, but I was happy to have a pacing group. But then the older guy took the lead for the fifth kilometer, and took us to a 4:59, and we were overtaken by a strong looking guy from behind us. This wasn't enough for the tall guy or the guy from the couple, and they slowly got away from us.

Splits: 4:36, 4:55, 4:51, 4:44, 4:58

### Kilometers 6 to 12
After the 4:59 I was feeling pretty good, and I was also feeling held back by our pace leader, so halfway through the 6th I decided to go ahead as well. I was already almost a minute ahead of my goal, so I could afford to try a faster pace for a bit, and still recover if I couldn't hold it. If the group came with me, cool, but I didn't want to risk dropping below 5:00 yet. The guys that had left our group were still ahead, but within 200m or so. But I soon left the group behind. Heading up to the start area to start my second lap (9k) I swallowed a couple of snake jelly candies, which I washed down with a few swallows of electrolytes from a lovely volunteer. For most of this period it was just me, with my faster former groupmates not far ahead, overtaking marathoners (and being overtaken by marathon leaders). This probably suited me better than a pace group anyway, as it gave me the benefits of group motivation, but I could still be a little flexible with my pace. I took electrolytes at the 12k, and I was feeling pretty good, so despite already being well on track for finishing my A goal, I decided to push a little more and see if I could catch the guys ahead. This also happened to be a good time to push for a negative split, but of course I didn't realise that because Running Brain was not capable of that kind of coherence at that point.

Splits: 4:49, 4:54, 4:50, 4:51, 4:50, 4:54, 4:50, 4:45

### Kilometers 13 to 17
I couldn't catch them. Despite my soft kick, they remained tantalisingly ahead. I took two more snakes and water at the 15: One lap to go! I glanced at my watch. I already knew I was well ahead of my planned pace, but I could see that 1:41 was achievable. I was thinking about that when, suddenly, as we rounded a few corners... were they delayed by traffic? I found myself definitely closer to the guys in front. And then closer again. I reckon I can definitely get them!

Splits: 4:48, 4:42, 4:47, 4:45, 4:39

### Kilometers 18 to 21.1
Turn after turn, I got closer. I passed a guy with a sloshing water backpack who had come past earlier. I passed the old guy's tall mate. I passed the guy from the couple. I passed the tall guy, and the strong looking guy! I got them all! And then, disaster. At the start of the last kilometer, a stitch came on hard and fast. I changed up my breathing to manage it, and it quickly subsided, but the pace drop - and their own kicks - was enough for the tall guy and strong guy to whip past me through the final turns.

Splits: 4:39, 4:41, 4:34, 4:42

### Post-race
I took my medal, and found a sunny spot of grass to collapse on. I ate a snake or two, and after a few minutes I got up and wandered off to find a park bench to stretch on. When I got home, I sat in my car in the car port for half an hour staring into space, enjoying my numb post-effort brain. Then I lined up some friends to meet me at a burger place for lunch. I needed food. And a shower. Shower first.

It's a pretty massive PB, but all my other halfs have just been training runs. Every fast attempt I've done has been 1:46 or worse, which is a testament to how a super flat course and even a small amount of atmosphere and having other runners on the course can add a huge amount to your time. Also a lot of things came together for this to go so well. I accidentally ran a textbook negative split, pretty well perfectly paced in terms of efficiency. I'm still not sure how I did it, or that I could do it again!

Chip time/new PB: 1:40:39

My first km was in the 4:30s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the turnaround I&amp;#39;d settled into a group of three others - an older guy, and what I thought were a couple. The older guy said he was aiming for 1:45, so I knew I was in the right group. He identified another guy further ahead - a taller older guy - and said that he had the same aim but was a little faster. We were soon joined by a fifth, a young, tall bald guy. Together the five of us ran in the low 4:50s - faster than my plan, but I was happy to have a pacing group. But then the older guy took the lead for the fifth kilometer, and took us to a 4:59, and we were overtaken by a strong looking guy from behind us. This wasn&amp;#39;t enough for the tall guy or the guy from the couple, and they slowly got away from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splits: 4:36, 4:55, 4:51, 4:44, 4:58&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kilometers 6 to 12&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 4:59 I was feeling pretty good, and I was also feeling held back by our pace leader, so halfway through the 6th I decided to go ahead as well. I was already almost a minute ahead of my goal, so I could afford to try a faster pace for a bit, and still recover if I couldn&amp;#39;t hold it. If the group came with me, cool, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to risk dropping below 5:00 yet. The guys that had left our group were still ahead, but within 200m or so. But I soon left the group behind. Heading up to the start area to start my second lap (9k) I swallowed a couple of snake jelly candies, which I washed down with a few swallows of electrolytes from a lovely volunteer. For most of this period it was just me, with my faster former groupmates not far ahead, overtaking marathoners (and being overtaken by marathon leaders). This probably suited me better than a pace group anyway, as it gave me the benefits of group motivation, but I could still be a little flexible with my pace. I took electrolytes at the 12k, and I was feeling pretty good, so despite already being well on track for finishing my A goal, I decided to push a little more and see if I could catch the guys ahead. This also happened to be a good time to push for a negative split, but of course I didn&amp;#39;t realise that because Running Brain was not capable of that kind of coherence at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splits: 4:49, 4:54, 4:50, 4:51, 4:50, 4:54, 4:50, 4:45&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kilometers 13 to 17&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t catch them. Despite my soft kick, they remained tantalisingly ahead. I took two more snakes and water at the 15: One lap to go! I glanced at my watch. I already knew I was well ahead of my planned pace, but I could see that 1:41 was achievable. I was thinking about that when, suddenly, as we rounded a few corners... were they delayed by traffic? I found myself definitely closer to the guys in front. And then closer again. I reckon I can definitely get them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splits: 4:48, 4:42, 4:47, 4:45, 4:39&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kilometers 18 to 21.1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn after turn, I got closer. I passed a guy with a sloshing water backpack who had come past earlier. I passed the old guy&amp;#39;s tall mate. I passed the guy from the couple. I passed the tall guy, and the strong looking guy! I got them all! And then, disaster. At the start of the last kilometer, a stitch came on hard and fast. I changed up my breathing to manage it, and it quickly subsided, but the pace drop - and their own kicks - was enough for the tall guy and strong guy to whip past me through the final turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splits: 4:39, 4:41, 4:34, 4:42&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my medal, and found a sunny spot of grass to collapse on. I ate a snake or two, and after a few minutes I got up and wandered off to find a park bench to stretch on. When I got home, I sat in my car in the car port for half an hour staring into space, enjoying my numb post-effort brain. Then I lined up some friends to meet me at a burger place for lunch. I needed food. And a shower. Shower first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a pretty massive PB, but all my other halfs have just been training runs. Every fast attempt I&amp;#39;ve done has been 1:46 or worse, which is a testament to how a super flat course and even a small amount of atmosphere and having other runners on the course can add a huge amount to your time. Also a lot of things came together for this to go so well. I accidentally ran a textbook negative split, pretty well perfectly paced in terms of efficiency. I&amp;#39;m still not sure how I did it, or that I could do it again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chip time/new PB: 1:40:39&lt;/p&gt;

**What:** 220 Days Sober Marathon

**When:** 08/29/2020

**Where:** Jersey Shore

I know that race reports aren't particularly thrilling when they aren't, you know, *real* races, but given that there are no live marathons happening around here anytime soon, I figured I would indulge in sharing the story of my first marathon. I'm not a huge fan of races in general; I ran the Philly Half-Marathon last autumn and found the whole experience very stressful and claustrophobic. I will probably never run a real race again. Anyway...

It's call the 220 Days Sober Marathon, although it was supposed to be the 7-months Sober Marathon, originally scheduled for last Saturday. However, a minor injury had me push it back a day (becoming the 7-months-and-One-Day Marathon), but I was then derailed by a fast and furious bout of depression. Only 5-miles into that try I ended up asleep on a park bench.

Luckily I was able to shake it off after only a few days and picked up my training again. I was only scheduled for 18 miles on today's long-run, but two steps in I knew today was the day.

# Training

I have been working with a running coach since January-ish. Health issues - including a month-long impatient stay to deal with my bipolar disorder and alcohol addiction, and a breast reduction in April - slowed things down considerably. But since I recovered from my surgery in May I've been mostly full-steam ahead. Losing a bunch of weight from the surgery and religious CICO tracking also really helped step up my running game.

My training schedule is pretty standard. I slowly got up to 40/50 miles a week. Monday is rest day. Wednesday is workout day (various intervals) and occasionally I dabble in doing double run days.  I think I realized that I don't love tapering in prep for big runs. I need a pretty steady weekly running schedule (not just number of runs, but total miles too) to help keep my moods stable.

Having a coach is wonderful and I think the best way to stay motivated and accountable. He has been incredibly supportive and inspirational, funny and frustrating, and steady rock in my life while I've been navigating some hard ups-and-downs these past few months. Sobriety's not easy! And if he's lurking and reading this, I hope he knows that not only would I not be running marathons without him, I would absolutely not be alive today.

# Pre-race

Big bowl of oatmeal with nuts, fruit, and peanut butter, and two cups of coffee.

# Race

Turned my watch on (Coros Apex), started my running playlist (instead of my 25 hour audiobook on Winston Churchill), took two steps, and knew I was feeling good.

At 2 miles a steady rain started and didn't stop until mile 22. It was glorious. For some reason the rain lessened the affect of the headwind (my biggest running foe), and the waterlogged shoes just masked the little pains of blisters forming. I loved jumping around puddles and alternating my pretty standard, straight, and flat route due to flooding streets and sidewalks. But most importantly, there was no one out! Usually saturday long runs cause me a bit of mental anguish....not because of the distance, but because I live in an area where everyone is out and about on a nice saturday. Not only do I have to play frogger a bit, but I also spend a lot of time feeling shitty about myself watching beautiful fit people prance around while I'm slogging through my long run. I know it's pathetic and I should ignore other people, but it's a major drain on my mental health and self-esteem. But not today! It was just me and a few other runners splashing through the rain.

Mile 20 hit me pretty hard and I took a pause/walk for a quick snack. That got my through mile 23, but man those last 3 were tough. My body was just going and my mind was doing all it could to ignore the fatigue. I wish I had one more snack with me; a burst of sugar would have made all the difference for that last 5k.

# Post-Race

Pizza and ice cream, obvs!

My feet don't look terrible for being soaking wet for 24 miles. After an hour or so of aches and pains, I'm feeling A-OK right now. Looking forward to a 3-mile shake out jog tomorrow morning.

# What's next

Well, a 50k is only like 5 more miles, right? I just need more snacks. Something to aim for celebrating 9 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back a month and a half was where I took the first step to getting back to real life and in shape again. Still having home office, but feeling MUCH better adapted and now know how to work efficiently enough and still be productive.

My first step in this tale is that I stopped drinking completely, I stopped with all the sweets/candy and just said fuck it, I can fucking do this.


Going back pretty much exactly a month I saw a reddit post about running and it got me intrigued. I started running and it felt good. It felt really good.

Coming from a background of a lot of sports when I was younger (Wrestling semi professionally, soccer, ice hockey, golf, everyring you can name I've probably done it) I felt extremely burnt out at the age of 21 (now 28) and went from being rather slim and fit to overweight. It's been a rough couple of years but I've finally taken my life back and started doing something about it.

So back to the running topic: I've now ran for around a month. I started off with a 3km run and had an average pase of 6 minute 54 per km. I am now up at 4km per session and today I did 5 minute 41 second per km. I've improved myself and my time by 1 minute and 13 seconds over the course of a month. Please note that I have a very good physice coming from a lot of sports from before. Please also note that I've not increased the time unless I felt like I could do it. The times I've done lately have felt really good and not at all exhausting to the point of me feeling like I wanna puke. I've felt exhausted of course but never more than that.

I just want to give a massive thank you to everyone on this subreddit for the tips and tricks you provide and to anyone who reads this messy post.

This is the best I've felt in years and it's mainly because of you all. Thank you so much.

So I live near two relatively-large universities and students have moved in for the fall semester (this is relevant later). Smack in the middle, there's a rather large reservoir, about 3 miles in circumference, that people—students, locals, elderly alike—like to walk, run, workout, etc.

Full disclaimer: I'm 6', 215lbs who, until recently, was your prototypical weight-smasher.

Easy 5-miler today so high 8s, low 9s per mile pace. ""Keep it disciplined, keep it steady, reserve your chaos..."" I'm telling myself. Then all of a sudden...

...this girl runs right past me. Let's call her Beth.

""**Damn,** she's fast. Don't get caught up making this a competition, this is an easy 5-miler.."" I reaffirm to myself.

Pretty quickly though, I notice that her right leg noticeably paws outside—as if she's striding deliberately outside her silhouette. Whatever, maybe she's injured or something. She's running a good bit faster than I am, so she'll be a good pacer for me.

I'm maybe around 30 meters behind her and she runs right past these two women, who seemed like they were college-aged. As Beth runs past them, one of the girls begins mocking aforementioned stride—**literally**. Her friend starts giggling and joins in on mocking said stride.

**Here's the ""funny"" bit:** as I'm running past them, at a clearly slower pace than Beth who's passed me, I can overhear them saying something along the lines of: ""See? That's how an athlete should run!""

**I know rationally** these girls are just really jealous and manifest said low self-esteem by putting other people down (frankly, and unequivocally, much less fit than Beth).. but as I started foam rolling after my cool-down I found myself **really** irked by this behavior.

Was making decent progress then my calf started acting up and I didn’t want to seriously injure it so I decided to give it a break back in June. I started hiking instead.

,running,"Some context: 

I've been running for a few years now. I don't run as much as I used to before, but I still try to run 1.5-2 miles 6 days a week.

That being said, about 2 weeks ago when I was out on my daily run, I noticed a real shift in my breath. I was heavy breathing even when I had barely started my run and not tired yet. It was subtle, but noticeable. It got worse the next couple of days. 

My gf then urged that both of us get tested for covid. We did and I tested positive. Luckily, it wasn't severe(might be due to the fact that Im a pretty healthy, young guy).

I never considered covid to be the cause since I never noticed the shortness of breath when I'm being stagnant/doing small things which, apparently, you should when you do have it. I only ever noticed it when I would be on my run.

Moral of the story: if you feel something while running/exercising and even if you don't feel anything while not active, whether it be minor aches and pains or subtle changes like immediate shortness of breath, if it lingers, stop what you're doing and get it checked out or (cautiously)self-diagnose and rest. You never know if it'll be serious or not.

EDIT: To clarify some things.

1. The screening we do at work is only temp checks, so if you don't have a fever, it's unlikely it'll be caught. My job urges us to self diagnose and not come to work if we even feel any slight symptoms at all, though Im sure that didn't stop other people from going in anyways.

2. We do wear masks at work at all times. We're not at work for prolonged 8 hours a day like we used to due to the pandemic and the fact that we just finished our most recent big project so we've been taking it slow and easy.

3. We don't get the pandemic stimulus funds from the government because we're already government funded to begin with and we are not a private or public company. We are a government research organization/agency. It might not be very effective, but the screening is not just for show to get more funds from the government like someone had pointed out. 

4. As far as Im concerned, all my other colleagues that I work with in close proximity regularly all tested negative(fortunately). No one has reported to have contracted the virus aside from me, which led me to think that I didn't get it from work. But, again, without tracing my virus, who exactly knows?

,running,"Hi all,

I hope you are all well. I apologise in advance, this is my second self indulgent article focussed on my own achievements, but after the amazing feedback and conversation from my sub 40 min 10k effort earlier this month I wanted to share my half marathon run this morning. 

My long term target has been to beat the elusive 90 minute HM time barrier. Not a lot has changed since my last 10km post as my regime etc is roughly the same, but still I have detailed my running gear, training regime and running history.

In a nutshell I started running from scratch in March 2020, I'm almost 40 years old and am at the end of a Garmin 16 week half marathon training programme.

\### Training  
A little about me.

\- Male, 39 years old, 5ft 10 (1.78m), 141 lbs (I've lost over a stone during training).

\- I ran cross country competively at school (ages 11 to 16) but hated track work.

\- I didn't run or participate in any physical sports or activity then until Oct 2015 - yes, 18 years later! I trained for the Sheffield half marathon (due in March 2016). Training went well for the 6 months but I pushed myself too hard which led to (what I think) were deficiencies (calories and vitamins) and the doctor saying he wanted me to stop training 2 weeks before the half marathon and pull out - gutted.

\- I lost heart and didn't run for 6 months, and from Sept 16 to Nov 18 I I did the odd run every few weeks - I had fallen out of love with running

\- From Dec 18 to March 2020 I didn't run at all - not 1 mile :-(.

\- Finally in March 2020 during lock down my non running wife showed an interest in the couch to 5k 10 week program which we both did. I bought her a new watch as a gift and a few weeks later I bought myself a Garmin 735xt and HR strap, upgrading from my reliable TomTom Runner. The Garmin programmes and new tech sparked interest, as well as some new trainers, and motivated me to pick up where I had left off in 2015/16. I have trained differently, more cleverly, by running by heart rate zones based on lactate threshold. I'm now at the end of and just completed a 16 week Garmin Connect 16 week training plan. I opted for the intermediate heart rate zone training planning. It was slow at first but my zone 2 lower ranges have picked up in pace and can now comfortably run at 7:30 min miles at a low heart rate.

\- I did a time trial on the 4th July (week 8 in the plan) as a tester and hit 40:22, and was so close to beating my target of 40 min 10km. 

\- I then ran on the 6th August 2020 on a track and achieved a 38:37 10km. 

For those interested in training schedules I have gone into depth for a usual day. I'm an early morning runner, alarm goes off at 6am everyday, get dressed, 400ml of water, nothing to eat, wee and poop (mandatory) and out the door by 6:15 without fail. I do not do warm up excercises, I start all my runs with easier paces and build into it. My weekly mileage ranges from 35 to 45 miles per week.

My weeks have been varied but roughly follow:

**Monday** \- an easy 45 min run heart rate zone 2 (6'ish miles at 8:30 /mi pace). I usually hit the trails for more hills and challenges, focussing on keeping my heart rate down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga. An afternon walk with the family usually works for the legs usally covering 3 miles.

**Tuesday** \- Interval training for 45 mins, intervals varied but max out at heart rate zone 4 (6:20 /mi pace) and rest back down to heart rate zone 2. I do these session by doing laps of my local park, which are exactly 1 mile in length. Usually cover off 7 to 8 miles in total as I start with a 1 mile warm up easy run and a 2 mile easy run cool down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Wednesday** \- an easy 45 min run heart rate zone 2 (6'ish miles at 8:30 /mi pace). I keep this to road/pavement running with a few hills. + Adriene Post Run Yoga

**Thursday** \- rest day. I usally cross train with a mountain bike ride, pilates session or Hiit Tabata session from youtube. An afternoon walk with the family usually works for the legs usally covering 3 miles.

**Friday** \- Threshold/Hills/ or Tempo training for 45 mins, varied but max out at heart rate zone 4 (6:20 /mi pace) and rest back down to heart rate zone 2. I do these session by doing laps of my local park, which are exactly 1 mile in length, unless they are hills which I use trail woodlands. Usually cover off 7 to 8 miles in total as I start with a 1 mile warm up easy run and a 2 mile easy run cool down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Saturday -** My favourite day, easy heart rate zone 2 long run day. My exploration run, finding a 100% trail route and dissapearing into new trails for a couple of hours - I love following the little breadcrumb trail on my watch. The distance has increased through the program ranging from 8 miles to 16.5 miles, I covered the 16.5 miles in 2hr 17 mins at an easy heart rate zone pace. The recent weeks have mixed easy pace with faster race pace intervals. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.

**Sunday** \- Rest day. A longer 45 min Adriene Yoga stretch session. I may do a family bike ride or walk.

**Training kit/ gear:**

\- Trail: Altra Lone Peak 4.0 (love these!)

\- Speed Sessions: Nike Flex Run 2015 or Asics Piranha SP4 (my fastest lightest shoe)

\- General Easy Run road shoe: New Balance Vazee Rush (now falling apart!)

\- Watch: Garmin 735xt

\- **Nutrition:** as above 400ml of water, unless its a long run of over 2 hours, I take a handful of gummy sweets and have 2 or 3 per mile (as a treat) and take one High5 energy gel at mile 4 or 5. I do not take water with me as the mornings are cool enough in the UK.

\### Pre-race  
My usual routine as above, however this time I ate 4 small midget gems (gummy sweets) before leaving the house and took 1 caffeine raspberry Hi5 Gel and a pot of gummy sweets in my running belt (I did not use any of these supplies on route). I wasn't planning on going for the target pace/time today as it was wet and very windy (30mph+ winds) so decided to wait until Monday 31st August when conditions looked more favourable. I didn't warm up today, just left the house and set off running at a steady tempo pace and went by feel

\### Race  
As I set off I averaged a steady tempo pace for the first 3 to 4 miles, battling the wet cold drizzle and heavy gusty winds - I considered turning around and going back to bed. However at mile 4 something clicked, I was warmed up and throughout the whole run the traffic and 'traffic light gods' where with me as every driver seemed to let me cross and crossing lights all worked in my favour. The usual hills were challenging but my pace was picking up from 7:30 to an average run pace of 07:00, so why stop I was at target pace almost! So I went for it from mile 6, knowing the majority of hills had been completed and I could make the most of the down hills. The section of down hills around mile 9  caused uncomfortable stitches for about a mile, so I focussed on breathing technique and it soon cleared. I think by mile 11 I knew I was so close to my 90 minute target, but the last return leg home to complete the loop had some killer hills but I was focusssed and came in at 90 mins 10 seconds, so very close! But hey I have a target for next time!

\### Post-race  
A big drink of water with electrolytes, a shower and a big oatmeal breakfast. A family walk today helped ease aching legs and a beer or 3 this afternoon has not been unappreciated!

\### What's next?  
Well I've finished the fantastic 16 week Garmin programme. I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend the heart rate training programmes, the thrill of seeing pace going up against the same heart rate is a real boost. Of course putting in the miles are key, so I will have a few easier weeks of easy pace running and then return to a similar schedule as detailed above. My next goal will be to secure a solid sub 90 min HM, perhaps an 85 minute will be the next target. I may also focus on getting my 5k time down through speed workouts.

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are all well. I apologise in advance, this is my second self indulgent article focussed on my own achievements, but after the amazing feedback and conversation from my sub 40 min 10k effort earlier this month I wanted to share my half marathon run this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My long term target has been to beat the elusive 90 minute HM time barrier. Not a lot has changed since my last 10km post as my regime etc is roughly the same, but still I have detailed my running gear, training regime and running history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell I started running from scratch in March 2020, I&amp;#39;m almost 40 years old and am at the end of a Garmin 16 week half marathon training programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s HM Link:  &lt;a href=""https://www.strava.com/activities/3980249248/overview""&gt;https://www.strava.com/activities/3980249248/overview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Training&lt;br/&gt;
A little about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Male, 39 years old, 5ft 10 (1.78m), 141 lbs (I&amp;#39;ve lost over a stone during training).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I ran cross country competively at school (ages 11 to 16) but hated track work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I didn&amp;#39;t run or participate in any physical sports or activity then until Oct 2015 - yes, 18 years later! I trained for the Sheffield half marathon (due in March 2016). Training went well for the 6 months but I pushed myself too hard which led to (what I think) were deficiencies (calories and vitamins) and the doctor saying he wanted me to stop training 2 weeks before the half marathon and pull out - gutted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I lost heart and didn&amp;#39;t run for 6 months, and from Sept 16 to Nov 18 I I did the odd run every few weeks - I had fallen out of love with running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- From Dec 18 to March 2020 I didn&amp;#39;t run at all - not 1 mile :-(.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Finally in March 2020 during lock down my non running wife showed an interest in the couch to 5k 10 week program which we both did. I bought her a new watch as a gift and a few weeks later I bought myself a Garmin 735xt and HR strap, upgrading from my reliable TomTom Runner. The Garmin programmes and new tech sparked interest, as well as some new trainers, and motivated me to pick up where I had left off in 2015/16. I have trained differently, more cleverly, by running by heart rate zones based on lactate threshold. I&amp;#39;m now at the end of and just completed a 16 week Garmin Connect 16 week training plan. I opted for the intermediate heart rate zone training planning. It was slow at first but my zone 2 lower ranges have picked up in pace and can now comfortably run at 7:30 min miles at a low heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I did a time trial on the 4th July (week 8 in the plan) as a tester and hit 40:22, and was so close to beating my target of 40 min 10km. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I then ran on the 6th August 2020 on a track and achieved a 38:37 10km. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those interested in training schedules I have gone into depth for a usual day. I&amp;#39;m an early morning runner, alarm goes off at 6am everyday, get dressed, 400ml of water, nothing to eat, wee and poop (mandatory) and out the door by 6:15 without fail. I do not do warm up excercises, I start all my runs with easier paces and build into it. My weekly mileage ranges from 35 to 45 miles per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My weeks have been varied but roughly follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt; - an easy 45 min run heart rate zone 2 (6&amp;#39;ish miles at 8:30 /mi pace). I usually hit the trails for more hills and challenges, focussing on keeping my heart rate down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga. An afternon walk with the family usually works for the legs usally covering 3 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt; - Interval training for 45 mins, intervals varied but max out at heart rate zone 4 (6:20 /mi pace) and rest back down to heart rate zone 2. I do these session by doing laps of my local park, which are exactly 1 mile in length. Usually cover off 7 to 8 miles in total as I start with a 1 mile warm up easy run and a 2 mile easy run cool down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt; - an easy 45 min run heart rate zone 2 (6&amp;#39;ish miles at 8:30 /mi pace). I keep this to road/pavement running with a few hills. + Adriene Post Run Yoga&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt; - rest day. I usally cross train with a mountain bike ride, pilates session or Hiit Tabata session from youtube. An afternoon walk with the family usually works for the legs usally covering 3 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt; - Threshold/Hills/ or Tempo training for 45 mins, varied but max out at heart rate zone 4 (6:20 /mi pace) and rest back down to heart rate zone 2. I do these session by doing laps of my local park, which are exactly 1 mile in length, unless they are hills which I use trail woodlands. Usually cover off 7 to 8 miles in total as I start with a 1 mile warm up easy run and a 2 mile easy run cool down. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday -&lt;/strong&gt; My favourite day, easy heart rate zone 2 long run day. My exploration run, finding a 100% trail route and dissapearing into new trails for a couple of hours - I love following the little breadcrumb trail on my watch. The distance has increased through the program ranging from 8 miles to 16.5 miles, I covered the 16.5 miles in 2hr 17 mins at an easy heart rate zone pace. The recent weeks have mixed easy pace with faster race pace intervals. + Adriene Post Run Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt; - Rest day. A longer 45 min Adriene Yoga stretch session. I may do a family bike ride or walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training kit/ gear:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Trail: Altra Lone Peak 4.0 (love these!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Speed Sessions: Nike Flex Run 2015 or Asics Piranha SP4 (my fastest lightest shoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- General Easy Run road shoe: New Balance Vazee Rush (now falling apart!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Watch: Garmin 735xt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Nutrition:&lt;/strong&gt; as above 400ml of water, unless its a long run of over 2 hours, I take a handful of gummy sweets and have 2 or 3 per mile (as a treat) and take one High5 energy gel at mile 4 or 5. I do not take water with me as the mornings are cool enough in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Pre-race&lt;br/&gt;
My usual routine as above, however this time I ate 4 small midget gems (gummy sweets) before leaving the house and took 1 caffeine raspberry Hi5 Gel and a pot of gummy sweets in my running belt (I did not use any of these supplies on route). I wasn&amp;#39;t planning on going for the target pace/time today as it was wet and very windy (30mph+ winds) so decided to wait until Monday 31st August when conditions looked more favourable. I didn&amp;#39;t warm up today, just left the house and set off running at a steady tempo pace and went by feel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Race&lt;br/&gt;
As I set off I averaged a steady tempo pace for the first 3 to 4 miles, battling the wet cold drizzle and heavy gusty winds - I considered turning around and going back to bed. However at mile 4 something clicked, I was warmed up and throughout the whole run the traffic and &amp;#39;traffic light gods&amp;#39; where with me as every driver seemed to let me cross and crossing lights all worked in my favour. The usual hills were challenging but my pace was picking up from 7:30 to an average run pace of 07:00, so why stop I was at target pace almost! So I went for it from mile 6, knowing the majority of hills had been completed and I could make the most of the down hills. The section of down hills around mile 9  caused uncomfortable stitches for about a mile, so I focussed on breathing technique and it soon cleared. I think by mile 11 I knew I was so close to my 90 minute target, but the last return leg home to complete the loop had some killer hills but I was focusssed and came in at 90 mins 10 seconds, so very close! But hey I have a target for next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Post-race&lt;br/&gt;
A big drink of water with electrolytes, a shower and a big oatmeal breakfast. A family walk today helped ease aching legs and a beer or 3 this afternoon has not been unappreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;br/&gt;
Well I&amp;#39;ve finished the fantastic 16 week Garmin programme. I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend the heart rate training programmes, the thrill of seeing pace going up against the same heart rate is a real boost. Of course putting in the miles are key, so I will have a few easier weeks of easy pace running and then return to a similar schedule as detailed above. My next goal will be to secure a solid sub 90 min HM, perhaps an 85 minute will be the next target. I may also focus on getting my 5k time down through speed workouts.  &lt;/p&gt;

5 weeks ago I decided to finally, fully recommit. I had just got hired at my Alma mater (I’m a teacher), and for the opportunity to volunteer and help with the team, so I started running with the team as well. I set the goal of running an 18 minute 5k after 12 weeks of training.

I have been running consistently (~15-20miles per week) for several months and have started to work towards a marathon now.

For the past two weeks or so as my distances have been getting longer I’ve been having a harder time controlling what I eat. (Ex.

 • Name: Lockdown Marathon

 • Date: August 28, 2020

 • Distance: Marathon

 • Location: Leicester, U.K.

 • Time: 4h 48m

**Goals**

Goal Description Completed? 

**A** Finish the Marathon? Yes!

**Training**

I used the Run With Hal, Novice 1 training plan. The time I had set to complete the marathon was far too optimistic. However the pace the training plan was getting me to run at was a comfortable pace for me, so I though I might manage it, until I saw the pace I had to run at for the Marathon. I gave myself 13weeks to go from a casual runner that had never gone over 15km to attempting this Marathon, i kind lost motivation a little over the 2 weeks before the Marathon as the training plan tapered off, but I’m glad it did. Over the training of plan I ran my first half marathon and then 4 more. 

**Pre-race**

In my longer runs in the past I had been really affected by temperature. I don’t have a clue how some of you in the US can run in 30+ degree heat (Celsius). There had been a bit of a storm over the UK at the start of the week and the weather for race day was looking wet and cold, which seemed ideal. Had a big dinner the night before and made plenty leftovers to eat the morning of the race as I would be running in the afternoon as I was working.

**Race**

It was a good afternoon for running, 16° Celsius and light rain. As I knew I wouldn’t be able to manage the time I set when I started training so I decide to take it very easy at the start and just try and find my zone. 

The route I had chosen to run was 2 loops of the half marathon loop I had used previously in my training, along a straight and level-ish cycle path that had been converted from and old railway line for about 7km, then along the river/canal in Leicester for 7km, the along the road back into the city for 6km to finish the loop. The section along the road was the most difficult with the elevation change, but on my second loop the rain started to get a lot heavier which made the section along the river a bit more slippery underfoot.

The first half went by pretty smoothly, I was remembering to drink, although this was not as vital as other runs as it was the coldest day we have had in a while, and it was raining. I was also pretty consistent with my energy gels having them in small mouthfuls and eating 1 gel over about 50mins. 

On my second loop that’s when I started to flag, by the time I was on the river section the rain was pretty heavy, and in just a vest I was starting to feel the cold. All along I didn’t have a time goal I wanted to achieve, I knew I just wanted to finish. This helped when I needed to walk as I was able to not worry about effecting my time and know that I would still be able to finish.

When I was close to the end of the second loop I realised I was going to be a few K’s short if I just headed home. So I took a turn to include one of the 5km routes I have ran before to make sure I arrived home bang on 42.2km. 

The last 10km was pretty brutal, it was really raining, getting dark and the wind had picked up. The energy gels didn’t feel like they were doing much, and I wasn’t moving fast enough to generate enough heat to keep me from feeling cold. 

When I ran into my estate to finish my girlfriend was standing out in the rain to video my coming in with a beer which was just the support I needed to finish. 

I can’t imagine what the feeling is like running past crowds of people cheering you on at an actual organised event. 

**Post-race**

I got back to my flat, tried to do some stretching but my legs were so sore I could barely move them. Got into a bath and stayed in there for a while to try and recover. My legs started to feel semi normal again so I made it to the couch were I sat eating pizza and watching a movie for the rest of the night, managed to get round to that beer about 4 hrs after finishing. I don’t know if it’s just me but the energy gels after a big run make me feel really full and almost a bit flu-y. 

**What's next?**

Not another marathon anytime soon that’s for sure. I’m looking forward to take some time off from running and get back out on my bike as it’s been sitting neglected all summer. But beyond that I want to focus on running faster, I want to focus on getting my 5km and 10km times down. 

I’ve been a follower of r/running for a while and I’ve picked up loads of good tips and tricks along the way. I’m never going to break any records and challenge in any races but hopefully some other people like me can see this and realise that with a bit of effort you really can do anything you set your mind to. If you had told me a year ago that I would have ran a marathon yesterday I would have thought you were insane. I think lockdown has been almost the perfect time for me to attempt this as I’ve not been commuting to work so I’ve been able to use that commute time for running.

I’m never going to break any records and challenge in any races but hopefully some other people like me can see this and realise that with a bit of effort you really can do anything you set your mind to. If you had told me a year ago that I would have ran a marathon yesterday I would have thought you were insane. I think lockdown has been almost the perfect time for me to attempt this as I’ve not been commuting to work so I’ve been able to use that commute time for running. And it was really great to have my mind focused on something during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm working as a teacher, and home schooling and vacation was a bliss. But the schools are back to normal in Norway, and things are starting to thigten up now. Job as a teacher, secondary job as a sales leader, lifting two-three times a week and a weekly mileage goal of 45-50 miles = both mental and physical fatigue.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering; will one workout each week, plus one long run, and the rest easy, be sufficent to keep 'em gains coming? I know the answer to this question will be; it depends on a lot. So here is some info:

76 kg,

Weekly mileage goal: 45-50 miles

10k: 39:30

BTW: 45-50 miles/week is pretty new for me. I was on 20 miles in february, and have been building gradually from there. From july, I've been on \~45 miles/week.

BTW2: I've came to the understanding that mileage is king. Maybe I'll be just as well of, gains wise, with one workout/week, and slowly increasing mileage, than with two workouts/week and no mileage progression?

,running,"Ok, hear me out. I have recently taken up running again. I have made several attempts in the past to get into running but have failed due to several reasons: running too hard too early, not having proper shoes, not having time to actually run. I also have scoliosis, which I think is something I should mention. Anyway, naturally, my failed attempts at running made me HATE running. And it's tough because my boyfriend can run 10K non-stop under the hot sun and call it an ""easy mid-day run.""

Fortunately, I found this sub and discovered the C25K routine. I decided that maybe this is the right time to take running seriously. I bought proper running shoes, and running shirts/shorts. I am now on my seventh week of the C25K routine and have really started to love running. It is the only time of the day when I get to just zone out and relax so in the past few weeks I've been looking forward to my next run on non-running days.

Anyway, as some of you may know, the 7th week of C25K is the one where you do a brisk walk for 5 minutes and then run non-stop for 25 minutes. This has been really tough on me and have been stuck on this week for 3 weeks now. No matter how much stretching and massaging I do, the muscles at the side of my left calf seem to really, really tighten at around the 15 minute mark. Most of the time, I can persevere for the rest of the run without having to walk but at the end, I'd almost be limping because of how tight my calf muscles are. I say I'm stuck at this week because I don't want to move forward to the next week unless my calf muscles don't tighten in the middle of the run.

As I have mentioned, I have done proper stretching and massaging in the particular part of my calf that tighten during the run. I'm also going to list some of the things I have tried to ""correct"" hoping the muscle wouldn't tighten too much anymore:

* Asymmetric breath pattern
* Making sure that I land on my mid-sole
* Not running too hard by making sure that I breathe through my nose
* As mentioned, stretching and massaging

I am starting to think that maybe long-distance running (for me, at least, 5K is ""long-distance."" I know long-distance for some of you is like 20K or something!) just isn't for me! And maybe, I should just stick to walk-run intervals. However, I think that training for 5Ks, 10Ks, and marathons would allow me to take it more seriously just because I have a goal. Unlike when I do walk-intervals, where the goals might be a little more arbitrary? What do you guys think?",t2_1rv1y3rm,False,,0,False,Is it essential to be training for something?

### Training
Race day was run streak day was 2,801. Not nearly enough hill or trail training.  Quarantine has been great for my training; I've been averaging nearly 11 miles a day in 2020. I did a few long runs of 30+.  I was going to run Western States this year, but it was cancelled, so instead I ran a 'solo' 60 mile run back in June from Philadelphia to my hometown in Macungie.  Typical training weeks were 70 miles, with a peak of 90.

### Race strategy
This has been a crazy time for everyone, I'm sure.  I honestly thought this race was going to get canccelled along with all the others.  However, the race directors put together a very comprehensive safety plan, and the race was ON!
Masks at aid stations, no spectators, only 1 crew member per person, starting in waves, among other things.  Figured this would slow me down a bit.

The elevation was ~8,000 feet, so I thought it would be similar to my previous run at [Umstead 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/bd8j2o/race_report_umstead_100_mile_endurance_run_just/).  I did Umstead in 20:32, so I was hoping I could trim some time off that and get under 20.  I WAS WRONG!

My good friend **A** also signed up for this race.  We had done the [Jackpot Endurance Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/7zk3m3/race_report_viva_las_vegas_a_24_hour_journey/) previously together. 

I planned 2 changes of clothes.  1 at mile 50, 1 at mile 80, with some backup rain gear and cold gear just in case. 

See here for [Packing List](https://imgur.com/gmjWXgK) 

My fiancee **J** would be my primary crew, with good friend **P** joining to help **A**.

Gu every 5 miles, salt tab every 10 miles, stop at every aid station to at least eat something.  Sip of water at least every mile. I packed my drop bags to refill on Gu / Salt / Chews, and gave candy and other food to my crew.

The course was out and back, so I planned no music for the first 50.  Pick up my headphones at the turnaround, and enjoy some tunes on the way back.


### Pre-race
Drove the ~6 hours from Philadelphia to Akron on Friday afternoon.  Checked into the hotel (right next to the start line!), grabbed our bibs, and got a decent pasta / pizza dinner at an italian place nearby.  Did some last minute planning, and went to bed by 8AM.  



### Race Day
Woke up around 3:00AM, quickly got ready, and walked over to the start line for our 4:21AM start.  The first group of 12 kicked off at 4AM with waves starting every 3 minutes. No spectators at the start (and the race director was shoo-ing people away!) so it was very different than all other races I've started, by a lot.

### Miles [1] to [25]

And we're off! The first mile was on a paved road with street lights, but after that, headed onto the trails around Cuyahoga National Park.  Headlamps were absolutely required.  It was cool to look back and see a trail of headlamps following in the woods.  The race directors recommended using the RaceJoy app so crew could track runners in the woods.  The app was good, but it could use some refinement, and I should have checked my settings more before starting.  It was audibly calling out split times every mile, which I'd prefer not to have, and it was a larger drain on my phone battery than expected.  It was VERY helpful in staying on the course.  The markers were generally OK, but there were at least 5 times when I wasn't sure which way to go, and a few times when the app had to remind me that I was off course. My watch also quickly started giving different readings than the app, I assume because of poor GPS coverage in the woods.   

I fell hard twice within the first 10 miles, and another time around mile 15.  This was a huge morale dampener.  The trail / tree roots / rocks were way trickier than I expected. My arms and hands were bloody and we were barely started! 

Chatted with another runner who was only doing the first 50.  He was in much better spirits than I was!   Stuck with **A** through the first 20.  At the first major crew point, it was great to see the crew.  Restrictions allowed only runners near the aid station.  Typically I'd have crew help grab food from the aid station / refill water and ice, but that was restricted this year due to COVID.  Just a minor plan change that adds up.  **A** stopped to change, so I had a small lead, then he passed me around 25 and I wouldn't see him again for a bit.


### Miles [26] to [50]
Started to see fewer runners.  The aid stations were OK.  Masks were enforced for runners at the table; then you could walk off and eat in the rest area.  The food variety was a bit lacking.  Due to covid restrictions, there was no cooking in the parks, so I usually just picked up a few potato chips / pretzels, refilled my water and moved on.  Tried to get some ice in my hat when I could!  Saw the crew at mile 33.  My phone was already at 40% so I picked up my large charger and carried it in my pack.  Another change to the plan, but I was rolling with it.

At this point I was definitely walking up every hill, and most of the downhills too, since I didn't want to risk another spill. Miles ~44 - 50 were on a very flat path, with limited shade.  I wanted to run fast, but in the mid day heat, it just wasn't happening.  I ran whenever I passed through the shade of a tree!  Got to mile 50, around 10:30 in. Finally!  20 hours no longer felt like it was within reach.  

Saw **A** here for a little bit as he had just changed, then he took off.  I stopped to cram down a cheesesteak.  Even though I told my crew I didn't want anything - I REALLY appreciated this, since all the aid station food was cold so far.  It was a great boost.  Changed clothes, refueled, drank some soda, picked up my headphones, watch charger, and I was off.




### Miles [51] to [75]
Miles 50-56 were just as terrible on the way back.  Once I got into the woods again I picked up a little steam, but not much. Listened to 4 episodes of the Car Talk podcast then switched to music.  Passing a lot of runners going the other way and we would share very small words of encouragement.  ""You're looking great!""  Sure I am buddy, sure...

Getting to the aid station at 61 felt like it took forever!  The miles were crawling by.  Saw my crew at ~66.  Realized I needed to pickup my headlamp there since I wouldnt' see them until after dark at mile ~80.  Some more enjoyable sections of the tow path, and then the sun went down.  The dropping temperature was great!


### Miles [76] to [100] 

Saw **A** and the crew again at 80.  Changed, then **A** and I took off together.  I thought we'd be able to stick together, but I was really losing steam mentally at this point.  My legs felt fine, but every time I started jogging, I would hit a hill, or some tricky roots to navigate, and I gave up and started walking.

A lot of numbers were getting crunched in my head, and I started to question the feasibility of 24 hours.  If I crawl / roll at 30 minutes per mile, it'll only take 10 more hours!  Around mile 85 **A** was way ahead of me.  There were relay runners on the course, and they would FLY by me with words of encouragement.  That didn't help much!  

There's some terrible smelling recycling plant around mile 87 that I remembered passing earlier in the morning.  Getting close! Took another wrong turn around here.    

It also didn't help that my phone was bouncing around in my pocket, so it became disabled for 30 minutes, then 45 minutes at one point.  I was EXTREMELY frustrated as I could hear texts / notifications coming in but couldn't do anything.  Eventually resolved that, after some loud curse words in the woods.

Saw the crew again at mile ~91 and that was probably the lowest mentally I've ever been in a race.  My splits leading up to that were between 18-21 minutes / mile (mostly walking).  **J** and **P** gave me some motivation and refueled.  I knew they had a tough decision of seeing **A** at the finish, or me at mile 96, so that gave me some reason to pick up the dang pace.  

Continued trekking through the woods, but moved a bit faster starting at mile 94, as the end was so close!  My headphones were dead at this point but I started to listen to music out loud. Made some phone calls to family which was really helpful.  Saw **J** at the last crew stop at mile 96, then thankfully she was able to drive back to the finish line in time to see **A** cross!

Didn't see many other runners the last 3 miles. I knew if I could keep running at least a little bit, I could break 24 hours. Started to rain lightly, which was actually extremely refreshing.  Saw some spooky cat eyes in the woods!

Finally got back onto the home stretch of streets at mile 99.  My last mile split was 12:45 which felt like sprinting at that point!  Took the positive vibes and crossed the finish line!


### Post-race
20 gus, 10 salt tabs, 3 pairs of shoes / changes of clothes, a cheesesteak, and 100.4 miles later, I crossed the finish line just after 3:30AM, official time of 23:13:10, earning a sub-24 hour belt buckle.  **J** and **P** were there to cheer me on.  We collected the buckle then drove the ~4 blocks back to the hotel, which I really appreciated.  Everyone had been awake for ~24 hours at that point, so we were all just exhausted and ready for bed.

My legs were throbbing so I didn't really get any quality sleep until the next night.


### Reflections
I was really frustrated by the difficulty of the trail.  I was arrogant to think that it would be as easy as Umstead, or the other flat races that I'd done in the past.  This frustration just got me down during the race, and I didn't really get past it until the last 5 miles.  

I will need to train a lot harder for Western States next year!

Extremely appreciative of the crew we had with us.  With all the aid station limitations around COVID, I would not have been able to do it without such an all-star crew.  This was **P**'s first time, and he did great!

I do have to say that I was a little frustrated with the COVID restrictions, and the enforcement of them.  ""No Spectators"", but there were pretty big crowds at the aid stations and turnaround points.  Runners with crew teams of 5+ people, when we were only supposed to have 1.  If I had known that the rules weren't going to be enforced, I would have planned differently, or not run at all.  Safety first!

I wrote this up about 6 days later, so I may be misremembering some items.

### What's next?
Nothing really planned until Western States next June!  I'll need to hit some trails before then.

&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 gus, 10 salt tabs, 3 pairs of shoes / changes of clothes, a cheesesteak, and 100.4 miles later, I crossed the finish line just after 3:30AM, official time of 23:13:10, earning a sub-24 hour belt buckle.  &lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt; were there to cheer me on.  We collected the buckle then drove the ~4 blocks back to the hotel, which I really appreciated.  Everyone had been awake for ~24 hours at that point, so we were all just exhausted and ready for bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs were throbbing so I didn&amp;#39;t really get any quality sleep until the next night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really frustrated by the difficulty of the trail.  I was arrogant to think that it would be as easy as Umstead, or the other flat races that I&amp;#39;d done in the past.  This frustration just got me down during the race, and I didn&amp;#39;t really get past it until the last 5 miles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will need to train a lot harder for Western States next year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremely appreciative of the crew we had with us.  With all the aid station limitations around COVID, I would not have been able to do it without such an all-star crew.  This was &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s first time, and he did great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have to say that I was a little frustrated with the COVID restrictions, and the enforcement of them.  &amp;quot;No Spectators&amp;quot;, but there were pretty big crowds at the aid stations and turnaround points.  Runners with crew teams of 5+ people, when we were only supposed to have 1.  If I had known that the rules weren&amp;#39;t going to be enforced, I would have planned differently, or not run at all.  Safety first!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this up about 6 days later, so I may be misremembering some items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing really planned until Western States next June!  I&amp;#39;ll need to hit some trails before then.  &lt;/p&gt;

,running,"Hi guys,

Started running (light jogging really) for 30 minutes at a time 3x a week two weeks ago and the cardio aspect is improving. I haven't been physically active for a long time though I'm only 120 lbs (M, 29). So I've been trying to take all the precautions to avoid injuries particularly with joints. So I'm paying a lot of attention to my body. Think I'm maintaining good form to the best of my knowledge from reading a lot of material here. Stretching 15 minutes after. On off days, I'm doing exercises to strengthen core, hamstrings, glutes, hip flexors etc. But I'm seeing slight discomfort or light pain here and there. Today, I'm feeling light pain right around or right below the right knee and also light pain in/around the right shin. No pain while running, just after cooldown. Not that bad but I suspect something may be still off with the form because I read in a few form related threads to the effect of ""you should bend your knees, the more the better"".

This cue I didn't really understand so I didn't pay too much attention to it. Can someone please elaborate what it means? I can't visualize that phrasing. Does that mean to keep the legs as NOT-straight through the movement as possible? I do take tight light steps by the way.

Looking for some help as to what would be my ideal HR for a tempo run of 5-10k? I know the rule of thumb is 220 minus age, but I'm 32 and have seen 194 on my watch when I've pushed hard.

As I say I'm 32, M, 6ft 3 and 205lbs (lost 20lbs this year). I've only been running this year really, more so since June and bought myself Garmin around 6 weeks ago as I'm really getting into it (props to David Goggins book for giving me more motivation)

I am far from fast but I feel like there's progress. 5km PB I ran last week was 25:59, so I feel like the initial goal of a sub 25minute 5km is now possible over the coming months. (I was running at around 32/33mins earlier this year when I got up to my first 5k)

When I ran my 5k PB my av HR was 174.. and the last km was hard on the lungs!

For ref, I'm doing 3 runs pw. One between 8-10k, one 1hr cardio HIIT with 20minutes on the treadmill &amp; 1 around 5k with a decent-ish pace. I want one of these to be a tempo run and/or I may throw it in as an extra run as Im trying to do every other day. 

Any other tips to help accelerate my progress?

/u/Bruncvik grabbed the top up spot.

&gt; A few weeks ago, I was visiting my parents, and as it was too hot to run during the day I did my usual 7 km route after sunset.  [This](https://imgur.com/YTvv0In) is what my shoes saw one of those days.
&gt; 
&gt; (The hill on the horizon is the very beginning of the 1500 km 
&gt;  long Carpathian Mountains range.)

/u/30000LBS_Of_Bananas grabbed the first runner up spot.

&gt; That would make me sad, I like this thread. 
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore I am digging into my archives, [this](https://imgur.com/a/NfUugAO) is from a trail run back in May.

/u/drgrlfrnd grabbed the second runner up spot.

&gt; I got to run near the beach this week! I paused my 7 miler partway so I could walk out onto the beach and get a few pictures. (No I didn’t run on the beach. My legs are no where near ready for that punishment. Also sand in shoes with 3 miles to get didn’t sound appealing.)
&gt; 
&gt; Oh and I don’t want this thread to die! I think the lack of races and race photos is part of the problem.

First, I admire his passion for running and overall good spirit, but running everyday for 3 years and now that he’s injured he’s still trying to “keep the running streak alive?” For what? I’m sure he’ll be doing way better if he runs like a normal person with some rest days here and there. 

I’m kinda worried that instead of running for health, now his motivation is probably more like the pressure of “keeping the running streak alive” at any cost by any means necessary for the YouTube/Instagram audience especially since he got a sizable one now. No idea if anyone in that audience is sensible enough to offer sensible advice about the importance of rest for recovery and progress and preventing injury, or perhaps they all cheer and feed him the urge to “keep the daily running streak alive.”

What’s worse I’m concerned that average people who watches his channel would think that running everyday for years even through injury is ok and then try it, thinking that “impossible is nothing,” or any of that crap. 

Ah anyway, I hope he heals and will come to realize that nobody is going to crucify him if he takes one or two days rest per week.

,running,"I've carried pepper spray with me for many years because there are coyotes in the open space area where I run from time to time. Today as I was running towards the open space on a paved street, two medium sized dogs (not pit bulls) escaped from a house about 100 yards away and started chasing me. I heard their owner yelling for them. I initially thought to start sprinting away but decided to stop and turn towards them and wait to see if they stopped. But they didn't and when one of them was about 3 feet away I pepper sprayed it. It whimpered away but the other dog behind it kept coming. It also eventually stopped and turned around without having to use it a second time.

Once it was over I continued running without talking to the owner. Do I need to report this to the police? I don't know which house it escaped from. I'm in CA where small size canister is permitted for self defense. In the future should I try to outrun it if it's not a big dog?

**Update #1**

I called the police to report this incident, and the dispatcher took down my name and number and said they will check to see whether they can find out if the dogs are ok and call back if necessary. My initial impression is they were more concerned about the dogs' well being than my own because I used pepper spray.


**Update #2**

The police apparently called animal services and gave them the details because I got a voicemail from animal services saying I need to provide an exact address (which I don't know) or they can't do anything. I called animal services back and they confirmed if this happens again there's no reason to call them to report this because nothing can be done.

C PR 10k Yes Prev 51:21 New 49:00!

D 50:00 10k Yes

**Training**

No real training plan. I run between 0 and 4 times a week. Usually I run a 5k, 5 miles, or a 10k just depending on how I feel once I get started.

**Pre-race**

Had been keeping an eye on the weather and saw a drastic improvement in Dew Point coming and decided to push myself. In the last week and a half I ran 10k, 13k, 9k, and 5k each faster splits than the previous with a day or 2 off in between.

**Race**

It was a perfect afternoon! 73°, 30% Humidity, 8 mph breeze. I was hoping to be consistent and run close to 5 minute splits the whole way, but came out of the gates faster than planned. 0.5 km in I knew I could break my 1k record so I went for it.

Decided to slowly ease my way back toward the 5 min pace and slowed down by 5 to 6 seconds on kms 2 through 4 running 4:37, 4:43, and 4:48.

Felt ok but a little gassed and disappointed when I realized at km 4 that I wasn't going to beat my 5k PR and hit a small wall that stuck with on kms 5-7 running them in 5:05, 5:09, and 5:11.

Then I realized that I could make another goal that I'd been targeting for awhile of 5 miles in 40:00. Ran km 8 in 4:55 to make it easily at about 39:10. This also when I realized that I was definitely going to break 50:00 and held near my target pace at 5:01 and 4:58 to finish strong and hit 49 minutes exactly. 


**Post-race**

I finished my loop maybe a quarter mile from my house and slowly walked back and did some light stretching. Drank water until I felt rehydrated and then drank a beer to celebrate.

**What's next?**

No idea, but probably start increasing my distance until I can run my first ever half marathon. Currently my longest run is 13km in 68:21.

I've been lurking here for awhile and you guys have definitely helped me be more consistent and I've been enjoying running more than I have in a decade. Since about May this has helped me drop about 15 lbs. When I started up again I was running about a 30 minute 5k and then was sore for days afterwards.

&lt;p&gt;• Location: Hartford, CT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Time: 49:00&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal Description Completed? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PR 1k Yes Prev 4:36 New 4:31&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B PR 5k No Prev 23:25 Fail 23:41&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C PR 10k Yes Prev 51:21 New 49:00!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D 50:00 10k Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No real training plan. I run between 0 and 4 times a week. Usually I run a 5k, 5 miles, or a 10k just depending on how I feel once I get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had been keeping an eye on the weather and saw a drastic improvement in Dew Point coming and decided to push myself. In the last week and a half I ran 10k, 13k, 9k, and 5k each faster splits than the previous with a day or 2 off in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a perfect afternoon! 73°, 30% Humidity, 8 mph breeze. I was hoping to be consistent and run close to 5 minute splits the whole way, but came out of the gates faster than planned. 0.5 km in I knew I could break my 1k record so I went for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided to slowly ease my way back toward the 5 min pace and slowed down by 5 to 6 seconds on kms 2 through 4 running 4:37, 4:43, and 4:48.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felt ok but a little gassed and disappointed when I realized at km 4 that I wasn&amp;#39;t going to beat my 5k PR and hit a small wall that stuck with on kms 5-7 running them in 5:05, 5:09, and 5:11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that I could make another goal that I&amp;#39;d been targeting for awhile of 5 miles in 40:00. Ran km 8 in 4:55 to make it easily at about 39:10. This also when I realized that I was definitely going to break 50:00 and held near my target pace at 5:01 and 4:58 to finish strong and hit 49 minutes exactly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my loop maybe a quarter mile from my house and slowly walked back and did some light stretching. Drank water until I felt rehydrated and then drank a beer to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No idea, but probably start increasing my distance until I can run my first ever half marathon. Currently my longest run is 13km in 68:21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been lurking here for awhile and you guys have definitely helped me be more consistent and I&amp;#39;ve been enjoying running more than I have in a decade. Since about May this has helped me drop about 15 lbs. When I started up again I was running about a 30 minute 5k and then was sore for days afterwards. The super common advice to slow down finally let me run more than once a week and it has been great to track my progress with time, distance, and health.&lt;/p&gt;

Transcript:

Outdoor air pollution may be the ninth leading cause of death and disability in the world, responsible for millions of deaths from lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory infection. In the U.S., living in a polluted city was associated with a 16, 27, and 28% increase in total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer death, compared to living in a city with cleaner air. Living in a city with polluted air may lead [to] up to a 75% increase in the risk of a heart attack. No one wants to be living in a traffic jam, but it’s better than dying in a traffic jam.

“In addition to causing deaths, air pollution is also the cause of a number of…health problems.” It may not only exacerbate asthma, but increase the risk of developing asthma in the first place. These pollutants may trigger liver disease, even increase the “risk of diabetes.” “[E]ven when atmospheric pollutants are within legally established limits, they can be harmful to health.” So, what can we do about it?

Paper after paper describing all the terrible things air pollution can do to us, but most failed to mention public policy. We’re making “great strides in demonstrating the harmful effects, [but] public authorities are not using these data to” reduce emissions, as they might inconvenience the population, “and, therefore, might not be politically acceptable.”

To treat the cause, we need better “vehicle inspections, efficient public transport,…bus lanes, bicycle lane[s], [even] urban tolls”—to help clean up the air. While we’re waiting for all that, is there anything we can do to protect ourselves?

Well, our body naturally has detoxifying enzymes, not only in our liver, but lining our airways. Studies showing that people born with less effective detox enzymes have an exaggerated allergic response to diesel exhaust, suggesting that these enzymes actively combat the inflammation caused by pollutants in the air. A significant part of the population has these substandard forms of the enzyme, but either way, what can we do to boost the activity of whichever detoxification enzymes we do have?

Well, if you remember, broccoli can dramatically boost the activity of the detox enzymes in our liver. But, what about our lungs? Researchers fed some smokers a large stalk of broccoli every day for ten days to see if it would affect the level of inflammation within their bodies. Why smokers? Because smoking is so inflammatory that you can end up with elevated C-reactive protein levels for “up to 30 years…after quitting,” and that inflammation can start almost immediately after we start smoking. So, it’s critical to never start in the first place.

But, if you do, you can cut your level of that inflammation biomarker CRP nearly in half, after just ten days eating a lot of broccoli. Appears to cut inflammation in nonsmokers as well—maybe explaining, in part, why eating more than two cups of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, or other cruciferous veggies a day is associated with 20% reduced risk of dying, compared to eating a third [of] a cup a day, or less.

So, what about air pollution? We know the cruciferous compound is “the most potent known inducer” of our detox enzymes; and so, most of the research has been on its ability to fight cancer. But, here, for the first time, they tried to see if it could combat “the proinflammatory impact of…pollutants such as diesel exhaust.” They took some human lung lining cells in a petri dish, and this is how many detox enzymes are produced. Drip on some broccoli goodness, and you can get this many. Yeah, but we don’t inhale broccoli; we don’t snort it; we eat it. Can it still get into our lungs and help? Yes, two days of broccoli-sprout consumption, then you suck some cells out of their nose, and up to 100 times more detox enzyme expression, compared to eating a non-cruciferous vegetable (alfalfa sprouts). Now, all we have to do is squirt some diesel exhaust up their nose, which is what some UCLA researchers did—an amount equal to daily rush-hour exposure on the Los Angeles freeway. Within six hours, the number of inflammatory cells in their nose shot up, and continued to rise. But, in the group that had been getting a “broccoli sprout extract,” the inflammation went down, and stayed down. 

Since the dose in these studies is equivalent to the consumption of one or two cups of broccoli, their “study demonstrates the potential preventive and therapeutic potential of broccoli.”

But, if broccoli is so powerful at suppressing this inflammatory immune response, might it interfere with normal immune function? After all, the battle with viruses, like influenza, can happen in the nose. Let’s drip some flu viruses into the nostrils of broccoli-sprout eaters, and find out. And, what you get is the best of both worlds—less inflammation, yet an improved immune response. Eat alfalfa sprouts, and you can get this kind of viral spike in your nose. But, after eating a package of broccoli sprouts every day, our body is able to keep the virus in check, potentially offering “a safe, low-cost strategy for reducing influenza risk” among high risk populations. So, better immune function, yet less inflammation, potentially “reducing the impact of…pollution on allergic disease and asthma”—at least for “an enthusiastic broccoli consumer.”

But, what about cancer, detoxifying air pollutants throughout the rest of our body? We didn’t know, until now. Off to China, where they have some of the worst air pollution in the world. And, by day one, those getting the broccoli sprouts were able to get rid of 60% more benzene from their bodies, a “rapid…highly durable elevation [in] the detoxification of…a known human carcinogen.” Now, this was using broccoli sprouts, which are highly concentrated—equivalent to about five cups of broccoli a day. So, we don’t know how well more modest doses would work. But, if they do, eating broccoli could provide “a frugal means to attenuate [the] long-term health risks” of air pollution.",t2_conix,False,,0,False,"For those of you who can't give up running outside when the smoke pollution isn't good, there might be a way protect against most negative effects with broccoli (sulforaphane) of all things.",[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-safety,0,,False,t3_ii9hvf,False,dark,0.38,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Safety,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598658493.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaJeHfmsA&amp;amp;t=3m45s""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uksaJeHfmsA&amp;amp;t=3m45s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,running,"30F, 115 lbs, non-smoker, low thyroid condition already treated with meds

Hi fellow runners,

It seems that the majority of my runs are done on tired/heavy legs. I've been running since March 2020 and I gradually upped my weekly mileage somewhere between 30-40km. I usually run 10k 3 to 4 times a week to be exact. My runs are considered what you would call fairly ''easy'' and I usually keep a 6:00min/km pace. I'm not into speed work yet, as I'm enjoying long easy runs for now and I like it that way. When I feel that my legs are starting to really get this heavy feeling I'm talking about, I usually rest for two days (time for the muscles to repair), although this doesn't seem to help as much as I'd like it to.

At first I thought this was due to upping my weekly mileage too quickly, which would have made sense, however I've been doing around 30k/week for at least 2-3 months now, and the issue is still there.

Other causes I think might be related to the tired-legs issue:

\- I've lost quite a lot of weight since I've started running (around 15lbs). Maybe I'm not eating enough for my muscles to fully repair after each run? I'd say I eat around 1800cal a day. I have a pretty clean and balanced diet. I also eat the occasional red meat (iron) and lots of good fats (nuts, avocado, pb, etc.)

\- I'm not very disciplined with stretching. I do stretch quickly after my run sometimes, but not all the time. Would this really make a difference?

\- I saw a post somewhere on this subreddit mentioning that ''cadence'' could play a role. Would making my cadence faster help with the issue?

Or might it be that it's actually normal to run through tired legs...?

&lt;p&gt;At first I thought this was due to upping my weekly mileage too quickly, which would have made sense, however I&amp;#39;ve been doing around 30k/week for at least 2-3 months now, and the issue is still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other causes I think might be related to the tired-legs issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I&amp;#39;ve lost quite a lot of weight since I&amp;#39;ve started running (around 15lbs). Maybe I&amp;#39;m not eating enough for my muscles to fully repair after each run? I&amp;#39;d say I eat around 1800cal a day. I have a pretty clean and balanced diet. I also eat the occasional red meat (iron) and lots of good fats (nuts, avocado, pb, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I&amp;#39;m not very disciplined with stretching. I do stretch quickly after my run sometimes, but not all the time. Would this really make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I saw a post somewhere on this subreddit mentioning that &amp;#39;&amp;#39;cadence&amp;#39;&amp;#39; could play a role. Would making my cadence faster help with the issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or might it be that it&amp;#39;s actually normal to run through tired legs...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance guys!&lt;/p&gt;

,running,"I picked up on running sometime around early June. It has helped me control my disordered eating and helped me become a healthier person altogether. I started off slow, running .5 to 1 mile at 14 min a mile stopping frequently around 4-5 times a week. I figured the calories burned weren't enough to log so I omitted entering my weight on ""Map my Run"" for the ""calories burned"" purpose. Now, a couple of months later I'm running 2-2.5 miles with little to no stops at an 11 to 12-minute mile.

I am currently on a caloric deficit and have been wondering if logging those calories as well would be necessary now that I'm burning a significantly larger amount of energy than I was then. I currently eat around 1800 ish a day,  give or take 150 ish cals.

It's also worth noting I am 17 Y 5'6F and struggle with restrictive eating and binge eating, although ever since I picked up running I have been doing very well at managing this, I track my calories to make sure I don't overeat too much but I mostly do intuitive eating, not restricting any foods to avoid getting into that disordered mindset again. At 14 I was super restrictive eating &gt;900-1000 calories a day losing lots of weight, messing up my menstrual cycle, and had hair loss. I would track every single calorie I ate, even if it was HALF a grape. This was awful, and going back onto this type of eating is terrifying, hence why I initially didn't want to know how much energy I was burning to avoid all the strict logging which is how I got into that situation in the first place.

This question mostly goes out to individuals out there who used running as a tool to work on bettering their ED's although any and all feedback is greatly appreciated :D

25M, 180 cm, 92 kg, not really fit, not really out of shape.

I’ve always been active (basketball, gym, martial arts, etc.) and recently been trying to pick up running since I signed up for a 5K race that’s happening in 3 weeks.

I’ve been watching my heart rate during my runs and noticed a weird pattern: anything that’s even 1 kmh faster than my ‘fast walking pace’ puts me in this hard to describe anxiety mode. 
It doesn’t really matter what pace I’m trying to hold (5/6/7/8 min/km), right around the 3K mark my heart rate shoots up and I feel like I’m having a panic attack. It only affects my heart and breathing, the muscles are fine.

Is this a mental thing? Or just cardio endurance? Have you experienced this? How do you stay calm during your runs?

The problem I run into is tracking the odd intervals.  I have a 400m loop, but for 600s, 800s, or 1000s I struggle to keep track of where I'm at, so I've been using the Jabra sport app, which I can create custom interval workouts in.

It might sound like ""New interval started... Goal pace, 800m at 7:05 mph""  and can then tell you to ""speed up to reach target pace"" and so on.  

Since the app doesn't work properly anymore and the voice coaching is intermittent, my interval runs have been all over the place; some tempo runs I've run slow and some interval runs are way fast.

,running,"Hey everyone. So I have recently taken up running again and felt soooo good for doing it for around a month now.

I purchased a watch which was supposedly very good at tracking your aciticty, your recovery time, that tracks anaerobic and aerobic training as well as vo2max etc.

So I am a 177cm guy that weighs in at 92kg. I am a bit overweight but I've been losing 4 kg in a month and feel really happy about it since I started running. It feels great.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically my questions:

* So my watch calculates vo2max and when I started running I was at 43 ml/kg/min which is considered ""fair"" and I've dropped times significantly (went from doing 6 minute 54 seconds per km ((3km)) runs to 6 minute 14 second per km (4km)) runs). The first times felt exhausting but the most recent runs I've felt much much better. However, the vo2max keeps dropping and I am currently at 40. What is this indicating? Am I pushing too hard? Is the climate too humid? Is it because I've also lost weight?

&amp;nbsp;

* So the clock also calculates the pulse and therefore if I am doing aerobic or anaerobic training. Last night I was going for anaerobic training to try and see how I faired and I was running with a pulse of 160 avg for 4km (which is around 70-80% of my max pulse). The watch said I did not do any anaerobic training gain that run, isn't that weird? It said during the whole run that I was in that phase. 

&amp;nbsp;

* I know a lot of people here say that you shouldn't care too much about stats and just run in their pace and enjoy it. I get that. But what should I mainly be thinking of if I want to maximize the training and still have fun doing so? I am still super eager to get out there and run and I feel extremely motivated because of the stats I am showing without feeling extremely exhausted after a run.

&amp;nbsp;

* The watch also calculates how long of a resting period I should have based off of my stats during the previous run. So if the watch have seen that I had a pulse of 90% max heart rate it will deter me from running for up to 40 hours which is fair. Usually now days since I've been running for little over a month it usually just tells me 24 hours since I am not dead after every run (I was super exhausted from 1 or 2 runs in the beginning)

I thank you a lot for your help guys, have a great day!",t2_71ftm,False,,0,False,As a new runner I need some advice! Thank you.,[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-question,0,,False,t3_ihjx3k,False,dark,0.43,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,0,,False,,1598530879.0,,[],{},,True,,1598559246.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. So I have recently taken up running again and felt soooo good for doing it for around a month now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased a watch which was supposedly very good at tracking your aciticty, your recovery time, that tracks anaerobic and aerobic training as well as vo2max etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am a 177cm guy that weighs in at 92kg. I am a bit overweight but I&amp;#39;ve been losing 4 kg in a month and feel really happy about it since I started running. It feels great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically my questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So my watch calculates vo2max and when I started running I was at 43 ml/kg/min which is considered &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;ve dropped times significantly (went from doing 6 minute 54 seconds per km ((3km)) runs to 6 minute 14 second per km (4km)) runs). The first times felt exhausting but the most recent runs I&amp;#39;ve felt much much better. However, the vo2max keeps dropping and I am currently at 40. What is this indicating? Am I pushing too hard? Is the climate too humid? Is it because I&amp;#39;ve also lost weight?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the clock also calculates the pulse and therefore if I am doing aerobic or anaerobic training. Last night I was going for anaerobic training to try and see how I faired and I was running with a pulse of 160 avg for 4km (which is around 70-80% of my max pulse). The watch said I did not do any anaerobic training gain that run, isn&amp;#39;t that weird? It said during the whole run that I was in that phase. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know a lot of people here say that you shouldn&amp;#39;t care too much about stats and just run in their pace and enjoy it. I get that. But what should I mainly be thinking of if I want to maximize the training and still have fun doing so? I am still super eager to get out there and run and I feel extremely motivated because of the stats I am showing without feeling extremely exhausted after a run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The watch also calculates how long of a resting period I should have based off of my stats during the previous run. So if the watch have seen that I had a pulse of 90% max heart rate it will deter me from running for up to 40 hours which is fair. Usually now days since I&amp;#39;ve been running for little over a month it usually just tells me 24 hours since I am not dead after every run (I was super exhausted from 1 or 2 runs in the beginning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank you a lot for your help guys, have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

Technically, she was on the wrong side of the road, I was on the correct side and she made me cross onto the wrong side.

I didn't care that she wasn't wearing a mask, because we had plenty of space between us. But if you're that uncomfortable being around people who are 6 feet away from you, you should at least wear a mask. I also think it's wrong that she swore at me. I'm 17, but she has no idea how old I am. I didn't think I deserved that. I was very upset and on the verge of tears for the rest of my run. :(

,running,"Since I own a GPS watch with optical HR sensor, I have been struggling to get decent heart rate measurements during running. Half a year ago I therefore upgraded to a chest strap, but I still didn't get reliable results. All too often the measured HR shoots up and down, and the measurements just don't make sense. Also, I don't like the feeling of a strap around my chest, so I went back to the wrist measurements and experimented a bit. Now it seems I stumbled upon an easy fix that is worth sharing here.

The trick that does it for me is to strap the GPS watch higher up on my underarm, and to wrap a dark wrist band around the watch. This achieves two things: 1) the HR sensor gets pressed firmly against my skin and stops shaking and moving, and 2) stray light into the optical sensor gets avoided.

For me this works like a charm. The downside is that I have to lift up the wrist band during running in order to see any info on the watch face, but for me this is a small price to pay to get decent HR data. (And on the flip side, there is the side benefit that I now look less frequently at my watch and run more on feel.)

Keen to hear if this works for other runners as well.

I've been using a Pegasus 36 recently and noticed that I've been getting calf pains when I run, possibly due to the change in the shape of the shoes from Pegasus 34/35 to the 36/37 silhouette.

The 34s used to be perfect for me as a daily trainer.

Was adhering to a decent diet and just now, after 3 months of training, I ran my first sub 5k, a 19:52. I do have to mention that before I started training for soccer I was bicycling quite a bit, last  year I bicycled roughly 4000 kilometers, this year I have only bicycled \~600km which was mainly before I started training for soccer. I did not bicycle before 2019.

My first 5k was \~27minutes

**Personal Info:**

20 Years old

Male

180cm / 5'11

\~74kg / 163lbs

**My plan:**

Day1: Soccer training (wont bother you with the details here) + Plyometrics

Day2: Soccer training + Upper body workout

Day3: Soccer training + Interval running (30s sprint 30s off, repeat 8 times, 10 minute break, repeat 8 more times) or a 5k. I would swap this around every cycle

Day4: Rest

I repeated this for roughly 3 months. I think its worthwile mentioning that before running the 19:52 I had a restday the day before because of some small pains in my right shoulder, luckily these where gone on the day of the run.

**My diet** wasnt anything too dialed, I eat roughly 3k calories. These calories consited of about 180g of protein, 130g of fat (have had people tell me this is too much but have not seen myself gain much fat), and about 230g Carbohydrates (too little here, I know..). And ofcourse drink plenty of water.

I did not drink any alcohol during these months, no sodas. Just water &amp; Smoothies.

**Supplements**

Omega 3,6,9 pills

Multi Vitamins

Protein Whey

Creatine

1) Just wanted to say I love this community and I have read so much on here that has helped me really enjoy running and also not get hurt.

,running,"I started running with Couch to 5k when I was in middle school, because I was tired of not being able to run down the block. I was slow, but I improved my endurance to the point where I could run for three hours (11.5 miles, but still). It was frustrating to be passed by run-walkers during the local 5k, but I was proud to finish: 12:51 pace! I adopted the identity of a ""slow runner"" and doubted that I'd ever break 30:00.

I joined cross country my freshman year of high school and ran an average of 11:22 for a 2.8 mile course. The next year, my PR was a 5k at 11:41 pace. That was my last season of XC, thought I kept myself moving with road biking and rowing.

Two years later, in the fall of 2017, I averaged 10:52 for a local 5k. Two years after *that*, after walking onto my college's rowing team, I averaged 10:02 for a 5k (PR'ed during a 4 mile run). When crew got cancelled this spring, I applied the intensity it had taught me to running. The past few months, I've PR'ed multiple times in the mile, 5k, 10k, and half marathon, and I even ran my longest run (20 miles!).

Today, in 65 **°** F and 95% humidity, I broke 30! I huffed and puffed my way to a 29:39 5k (average 9:33), knocking almost 50 seconds off my previous PR from early June. I keep seeing people running at my pace on Strava, and it's starting to sink in that while I'm not winning races against anyone else, I'm not so much of a ""slow runner"" anymore.

So for my fellow ""slow runners"" -- stick with it! It took me 7 years, but I finally achieved something I thought I just wasn't cut out to do. The key was learning to push myself. Collegiate rowing raised the bar for the kind of discomfort my mind and body can sustain. From 2013-2017, I was running hard on race day, but I wasn't training hard enough throughout the week. (I used to run the same 4 mile route every day at around the same pace! No wonder I broke up with running for a few months in eighth grade.) Lately, I've been pushing myself to hold moderate pace for 4 and 5 mile runs (that's 11:00 miles for me), and I've thrown in some track workouts (1 minute sprints or 400m repeats) to spice things up. It keeps things interesting, and it's making me faster!

Now what? Should I give myself another 7 years to break 25:00? ;)

Edit: Thanks for all the awards and kind words! I want to add a few things. 

I agree that there's nothing wrong with running slowly! My line of thinking is that slow runners should be celebrated for pushing themselves just as hard as fast runners over the same distance, but for, like, twice as long. For me, it's always been about beating my previous records, not anyone else's. 

Stories of new runners chopping their times in half in just a few months weren't encouraging to me when I'd been running for years and had never seen such quick progress. I wrote this for those of us who are chipping away, slowly and steadily, at our current times. 

And sorry for the km/mile confusion! Here in the US, 5k and 10k are commonly used distances, while we rely on min/mile for pace.

Keeping these needs in mind, and considering that it&amp;#39;s annoying to have a backpack bouncing back and forth. Can someone recommend a great commuter backpack that it fits comfortably when running and it fulfills my needs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help is more than appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

I started running a few months ago doing C25K. I was using UA cross trainers I got YEARS ago, so yesterday I went out and got a pair of Brooks Launch 7 shoes so I had something proper to run in since the UA shoes were hurting my feet.

In the end I managed to eke out another 4 and 8 min interval (with considerable rest), but dear god was I feeling it in my calves, and my cooldown was a brutal hobble back to my apartment.

Please tell me there's an adaptation period and I'll get used to these shoes. When I first started I exclusively did heelstrikes, but I practiced with my old shoes to do closer to mid/front foot strikes. It was a noticeable difference for my calves, but not as intense as this.

,running,"Hey all, 

I started running around 20 months ago, all my running is done outdoors rather than a treadmill. After a couple of months I was running 3x 5k's a week at an 11-12 minute mile pace (I know this is slower than most runners, but I'm doing my best). Some days would be faster, some slower, but I averaged this pace. 

This year I started feeling like I had a lot left in the tank after each run, so I started running 10k's at the same pace. Shortly after I bumped it up to 6x 10k's a week and maintained that for a few month or so, and then took a week off, then resumed. Recently, a personal trainer recommended I dial back my running a bit and add in some stair stepper. 

For about a month I was running 4 times a week, and stair stepping 3. I noticed I was struggling to maintain my pace, so I started running on the treadmill which forced me to keep a steady pace.  

Fast forward to now, and the past month or so I've been pushing for 5-6 days a week of outdoor running. The trouble is, I cannot seem to push my legs hard enough to meet my pace. If I'm lucky, I'm hitting a 13 minute mile pace and it feels like I'm speed walking. All in all, the feeling of high energy I got when I started running 10k's has dissipated, and I feel sapped. 

Other info: 
I lift 4x a week
Sleep 8-9 hours a night 
I run fasted, but hydrate and drink coffee before hand. I've tried running unfasted but I feel bogged down. 
I am currently eating at a calorie deficit, which has been true since I started running.

,running,"Like the title says, I’ve been struggling with calf soreness for months. I’ve been running about 30 miles a week since then, and I haven’t been able to increase my max distance past a half marathon, and I think it’s my calves holding me back. I have been running on hills one or two days a week, but other than that my runs are mostly flat. Pretty much every day when I lay down for a nap I have to put my calf sleeves on because my legs feel wonky. Three weeks ago I pushed through one of the hardest runs I’ve had to finish a half again and all day if I even stood on my tiptoes I’d get calf spasms for a few seconds.

I've given a shot at running a couple of times in my life, but never really kept going for more than a couple of months. This year however i've been running since January. Since then i've improved my speed a bit, and the furthest i've ran so far is 11K. I've just started a training program for a half marathon for my next goal.
Although i am improving, i'm relatively slow compared to most other runners. I run at about 8 to 9 km/h. (translates to 11 or 12 minutes a mile).

Based on my runs so far I expect I can run the race somewhere between 56 to 58 minutes, which fits within the 1 hour timelimit. 
Based on the results available from the races in previous years, there are 500-700 participants and with my expected finishing time this would put me somewhere in the last 10 to 25 people to cross the finishline.

My husband and I don't have children, but my best friend and her 3 kiddos moved in with us in May after her abusive husband took his own life (long story fit for a different sub). They are great kids and doing super well considering the circumstances, and recently the youngest who is an almost eight year old boy asked me if he could start coming with me on my ""marathons"" (LOL I run like 2.9 miles most days). He is the ""outdoor kid"" of the bunch, and he reminds me of how I was when I was little. He has a LOT of energy but also has a healthy sense of competition and is naturally driven and tenacious. He loves to run fast - we race often and he can almost beat me when I run full tilt. Moderation and self control are not his strong suit yet, but we are working on it.

I may be taking things too seriously, but I really feel that this kid needs a healthy outlet for his energy and would love to help instill in him a love for running (or some other active sport). Him mom and sibs are more on the ""indoor kid"" spectrum so they encourage him but aren't into the same activities. We have made it around the block (\~1/4 mile) using a stoplight system -""green light"" means run fast, ""yellow light"" means jog, and he can call ""red light"" any time he needs to walk - with the only rule being that we do our best not to stop moving during the session. Does anyone have any things they've done with their kids to make running fun and interesting? It bears mentioning that I do my serious runs on his rest days, and his runs on mine so I am not worried about exercise, just about his experience.

Hi all,

Some backstory, my brother and I were due to run an official race called the St Albans Stampede (UK) the first weekend in September. The event is cancelled because of COVID, but we're going to run around our town instead. We're raising money for charity (don't think I can post details so won't include here). 

We're trying to keep it as authentic as possible with similar elevation change and lap distance (6.5km) but we're really not sure if we should be aiming to cover more distance in one go on fresh legs, complete one lap each until the time runs out, things like that. We wen't out for a 26k yesterday (equivalent of 4 laps) and the pace just dropped off for the last 1/3. 

We're aiming for 20 laps in 12 hours, more if we can. That's what the official winners got last year. But if one of us locks up or gets an injury, we're toast, so if you have any advice on that front as well, that would be grand. 

Thank you.

Edit - At any one time, only one of us (from the team of two) can be running. So we can alternate laps (i.e. one of us runs 6.5km then swap runner) or when someone completes a lap they can stay out on the track and do another one. It's a tag team race...

So... today I had an easy 5 mile run on the schedule. For me, that’s usually around 9:15 or 9:30min/mi. Today, however, what normally feels easy felt brutal. The first mile was fine, miles two and three were a bit slower, and then halfway through mile four I was struggling so much that I simply had to stop and start walking. I couldn’t even muster the strength to sustain a 10:00min/mi pace.

But today, I just couldn’t.

,running,"TL;DR: Running a marathon is much harder than a half. You should probably do a program instead of just winging it.

Well, I ran my first marathon alone yesterday. After running countless 5/10k's I figured i'd try a half marathon a couple weeks ago. I ran it in about 2 hours with minimal trouble. I understand that's not a great time but I've never really been too interested in pace. So after completing the half, I wanted to try a full marathon so I could see generally where my ability was. I wanted to get a baseline time so I can see how much I've improved after completing a real training program.

I thought i'd at least shoot for an average goal pace which was 10:15. I hung in there with no problems until mile 21 where I stopped for about 10 seconds to fill up a water bottle. After filling it up and standing still for a couple of seconds, I physically could not make my legs run. I could only hobble. After questioning throwing in the towel, I hobbled for a mile until I could... somewhat run again. I ran and walked on and off until finishing well past all of time goals. 

I'm going on Hal Hidgon's program starting next week and I can't wait to see how much I will have improved. But for now I'm just happy to have finished frankly.

,running,"Alright. So Ive been back to running regularly for about a month. Im not fast, but Ive always been good with endurance. My biggest experience with exercise was comptetive dance, and I was fairly strong back in the day. Ive since had a baby and now that he is 2 Im working on losing quite a bit of weight, but my strength has come back pretty quickly. 

I have a feeling my history of dance had a big impact on the areas where my body (feet especially) prioritized muscle strength. My left foot (the base/ push off foot for most turns and kicks) has a good arch and ankle strength.  HOWEVER. I believe that years of leaning on my left foot has caused the outer edge of that foot to splay out. I move around a lot in my left shoe when running, and I struggle getting power out of that toe off. My right foot overpronates pretty badly, but Ive been able to strengthen it quite a bit to the point I have to try to show how it used to roll in OR it will do it when I am going up a hill at an angle. 

Im not here to ask about shoes, but I want to mention what Ive tried. I started in some old Mizunos that I had lying around, probably a full size too small on my right foot. Nasty blister on that heel that Im still working on healing. Then I bought Mizuno Wave Inspire 16s, in my regular shoe size (11 womens) but wide. My left foot started turning in the shoe and I wondered pretty quickly if it was simply too wide. 

I went to a running shoe store and asked for advice. I didnt have a lot of confidence in the sales lady, but she told me I was an 11.5, and that I should get a 12.5 in running shoes. I immediately started telling her I wasnt sure. I was already having problems with the left shoe wiggling around at an 11... but she eventually got me to leave with hokas in a mens 10.5.... I got one mile into my next run and knew it was a mistake. I wasnt even sure I wanted a full blown stability shoe. It seemed like part of the problem in my left foot was that the unnecessary arch support on top of the splayed outer side made my foot turn sideways. It was like running in sand, but without being able to adjust my foot without stopping and kicking my heel into place.

I went back to the store and worked with a woman I felt much more confident with and ended up with Saucony guides in 11.5 womens regular width. They are much closer to what I was looking for. More form fitting to my foot and not ""all heels"" as I said many of the other shoes felt. I still feel weird in them to a lesser degree, which is where my actual question comes in (sorry... lol)

When a person without foot imbalances runs, either in forefoot, midfoot, or heel strike.... where do you feel the pressure as your foot moves through the motion? My assumption is that with 2 balanced, strong feet, you would hit at whatever starting point but the foot would stay activated in the ball of the foot and you would push off with pressure mostly in your big toe and maybe the second. If proper running shoe fitting is to size up, how could anyone get their toes to the right part of the shoe to get that traction with the ground? Do runners with neutral shoes move around in the toe box and heel as well? Is there some phenomenon where a properly strong foot would simply keep its good form without spreading or moving in a loose shoe and it not cause problems?

Im mostly looking for experiences from runners without arch problems and those who have overcome them. Every shoe/insert and tweaks to my form Ive tried always seems to negatively affect one or the other foot. In fact, I experimented with taping the ball of my left foot, or stuffing that shoe to hold my foot in place, and I almost feel like im not even fully activating that leg when I run with the looser shoe. Its like my right foot is dragging my left along, because I lose any power from the left when I roll past the ball of my foot and over the side of my big toe.

I have a question that I can never find a good answer for about foot placement/sensation.,[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-question,0,,False,t3_igh8yh,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,1,,True,,1598378150.0,,[],{},,True,,1598406766.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright. So Ive been back to running regularly for about a month. Im not fast, but Ive always been good with endurance. My biggest experience with exercise was comptetive dance, and I was fairly strong back in the day. Ive since had a baby and now that he is 2 Im working on losing quite a bit of weight, but my strength has come back pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling my history of dance had a big impact on the areas where my body (feet especially) prioritized muscle strength. My left foot (the base/ push off foot for most turns and kicks) has a good arch and ankle strength.  HOWEVER. I believe that years of leaning on my left foot has caused the outer edge of that foot to splay out. I move around a lot in my left shoe when running, and I struggle getting power out of that toe off. My right foot overpronates pretty badly, but Ive been able to strengthen it quite a bit to the point I have to try to show how it used to roll in OR it will do it when I am going up a hill at an angle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im not here to ask about shoes, but I want to mention what Ive tried. I started in some old Mizunos that I had lying around, probably a full size too small on my right foot. Nasty blister on that heel that Im still working on healing. Then I bought Mizuno Wave Inspire 16s, in my regular shoe size (11 womens) but wide. My left foot started turning in the shoe and I wondered pretty quickly if it was simply too wide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a running shoe store and asked for advice. I didnt have a lot of confidence in the sales lady, but she told me I was an 11.5, and that I should get a 12.5 in running shoes. I immediately started telling her I wasnt sure. I was already having problems with the left shoe wiggling around at an 11... but she eventually got me to leave with hokas in a mens 10.5.... I got one mile into my next run and knew it was a mistake. I wasnt even sure I wanted a full blown stability shoe. It seemed like part of the problem in my left foot was that the unnecessary arch support on top of the splayed outer side made my foot turn sideways. It was like running in sand, but without being able to adjust my foot without stopping and kicking my heel into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the store and worked with a woman I felt much more confident with and ended up with Saucony guides in 11.5 womens regular width. They are much closer to what I was looking for. More form fitting to my foot and not &amp;quot;all heels&amp;quot; as I said many of the other shoes felt. I still feel weird in them to a lesser degree, which is where my actual question comes in (sorry... lol)&lt;/p&gt;

**TL;DR - I went for a run too late, it was pitch black on a semi-secluded mixed-use path, I was alone, I thought I was being followed, I was miles from my car. Please remember to bring a light and a phone with you when you run alone.**

Until they officially cancel Ironman Florida, I have to keep training so I'm prepared. As with almost all of their other races we won't be told until under 45 days out. I rode \~100 miles (160 km) yesterday and needed a long run today. I slept most of the day except for eating, stretching, and relaxing. Around 6:30pm I started to get ready so I could be done before dinner. In my head - ""It's been pretty light outside until 9pm lately so I should be fine."" Well, I keep my phone on military time - just something I've always done even though I'm not military. Turns out I am stupid it was really 7:30pm because I glanced at my phone incorrectly and maybe I was more tired than usual. So by the time I made it to the local mixed-use path it was just after 8pm.

I thought I would get a half marathon in by running \~4 miles (6.5 km) to a stop, 2 more miles out to turn around and come back to the stop, 4 miles back to the car, and then whatever else I needed to finish up. I ran to the 4-mile stop fine not really thinking anything of how much light was out because there were lots of people on the path still, but when I came out of the bathroom at the 4-mile stop it became immediately clear I had misjudged things because it was very dark all of the sudden.

I decided to forego running out to my turnaround and just head back from there. As soon as I was away from the stop it was incredibly dark and I could barely see anything because the path is lined with trees/woods on both sides pretty much the entire way. There are some houses near the path, but they're just far enough away that they don't provide any light. And probably just far enough away that no one would hear you scream.

And the fact that I was completely alone, with no phone or light, just out of earshot from anyone was all I thought about the entire time I ran back. There were a few random sidewalk entrances here and there, but I felt really stupid about walking up on a stranger or knocking on a door half naked to explain that I had no phone, had no light, had no mask, was afraid of the dark, and needed to call someone to come get me. 

With every passing signpost, bench, curve, tunnel, or large tree I would ball my fists and raise them up to my chest. I felt so dumb the entire time running back, but people have died on the path. There is a cross planted on the side some miles out reminding us about a woman who was alone and pulled off the path.

I was running around 8 min/mi (5 min/km) on the way out but on the way back I was going much faster. I ended up running around 35 minutes out and 30 minutes back, so cut 5 minutes from my time over \~4 miles (6.5 km). I kept looking over my shoulder to make sure no one was behind me but there was never anyone there. Except for when I saw some small lights approaching very slowly. They were fairly far back, but they looked like they were keeping the same distance. I started to get really freaked out. Then I noticed the lights weren't actually moving. They path was just so straight I could see all the way back to the last small crossing and they were stationary there. A sigh of relief a little bit. Until a mile later when the lights were now moving and were getting slowly closer and closer. Once they got close enough, I stopped running and just stood on the side of the path trying to prepare myself for anything. A really nice family of three riding their bikes and listening to music slowly pedaled by with some dim lights on the front of their bikes. I immediately tried to run their biking pace, but it was just fast enough that I couldn't keep up.

I made it back to my car, but it's going to be quite a while before I think I'm comfortable running at night again even with a light and phone. I should have done a lot of things differently in retrospect. But in the moment I just wanted to be home and kept running so I could get in my car and leave.

Current goal: Get my half down closer to 2hrs before an event coming up in October.

My Story:I joined a gym about a year and 3 months ago to just get into better shape overall. I'd work out about 5 days per week alternating between cardio (usually on an elliptical) and weight lifting. Eventually I got bored with being on an elliptical and switched to running/jogging on the treadmill. They were less frequently occupied than ellipticals. I was terrible at running in high school and had never completed a mile without stopping. I decided I was going to do that. I did and decided to just keep going eventually getting up to around 4.5 miles in my 1 hour sessions at the gym.

When I started running more 'seriously' I went to my local running store to get fitted for some decent running shoes. I had been having knee pains and I thought maybe my cross-training shoes may have been the problem and if I was going to increase my miles it would be even more important to take care of my body. My knee problems persisted for a little while after that but did eventually clear up. All good on that front now.

The Rona happened and I didn't want to lose all of my progress up until that point so I decided to keep running on the trails near my house. It kept me sane while we were in quarantine since we didn't really leave the house except to get groceries. I was racking up more and more miles with ease. However this is where my problems began.

I started getting a callus on the middle toe of my left foot. It never really hurt... it was just rough and kind of crusty looking. Not cute but nothing an at home pedicure every now and then wouldn't fix. I assumed this was just part of the running life.

One night about 2 months ago I ran 11 miles in one session and I decided what's a couple more miles... It's time to do a half marathon! So I did. It was a disaster which could be a whole separate thread about what not to do on your first half but that's for another time.

Since then I've been doing weekly half marathons. Aside from feeling really wiped around mile 11 or 12 or the occasional side stitch I never feel any pain. This is where my toenail problems kicked into high gear.

About 3 weeks ago I went back to the running store (same local chain but different location than before) to make sure my shoes were properly fitted, get a new pair of shoes, and what else I could do to prevent the loss of my toenails.  They had me run on a treadmill but said they didn't see anything wrong with my form. They found no issues with the way my shoes fit. The only recommendation was to change the way I had my shoes laced at the top (by the ankle). I moved the laces to the holes closer to my ankles to make the opening smaller and maybe assist in keeping my feet 'back' in the shoes in case my feet were sliding forward and my toes were rubbing on the front of the shoes. They also suggested changing my socks. I had been mostly running in cheap, lightweight athletic socks I got at walmart but in the week or two prior I had purchased a pair of lightweight smartwool athletic socks.

Currently my my middle left toenail has receded about half way up the nail bed. My middle right toenail is almost totally detached from the nail bed. I can't tell if there's a new nail growing underneath. The toenail to the right of that (4th toenail?) gets blisters underneath the nail bed/at the tip of the toe all the time. They never hurt during or after my runs. They just look atrocious.

Is the next step going to see a doctor? Try a different type of shoe? The guy at the running store said for some people sometimes toenails and running just aren't compatible. Is that true? Would wrapping my toes in some sort of athletic tape help? Tape them to each other? Wear some kind of extra cushiony barrier between my toe and shoe? Would it be beneficial to have someone observe my running form w/o shoes on? Am I just running too much (this seems unlikely)?

I bounce between being sad that I have such ugly toes and wearing them as a badge of honor because of what I've accomplished and how far I've come. But as I'm writing this I'm definitely more in the sad camp. :(

If you've made it this far I sincerely thank you for reading and appreciate any advice anyone can give.

## Background/ Training

33m, 6'3 90kgs. Took running seriously as of this year. Couldnt get under 25mins for 5k at the start of the year. Running about 50ks a week. Mostly easy 10-12k runs, with a speed set or tempo on tuesday. I dont really have a long run date, I've done a couple of 15ks here and there.

After hitting big 5 and 10k PB's I thought I'd try my hand at the half, set a benchmark. With our 2nd baby arriving soon and summer approaching. I can't see myself improving for the next little while.

I did a half time trial solo in 1:53 back in may. I know I've improved a lot since then.  I had a goal of 1:40, but really just wanted to hit every k under 5 mins and set a time. I think I didn't want to absolutely flog myself,  would save that for whenever I get to do an actual race leave a bit in the tank for a  stronger finish. Last time I did the half I started out in 5:05 pace, ended up at about 5:45.

You can read more here [5k Sub 20 race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/i5yqqh/26_to_sub_20_5k_this_year/)  or here [10k race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/i2r8jl/10k_pr_4232_stoked/)

## Pre-race

The course I chose was 7 and a bit laps around a lake near me. It's quite nice to run, though has a few twists and rolling little hills.  I thought I'd choose it so I can put out a few cups of gatorade at a table and grab one each lap. Plus I wouldn't have to bother about measuring out a course.

I woke up at 5, had an espresso GU, tasted a bit funny but ok (new flavour for me). Was about to head out the door and realized my watch had little battery.  Big fail! I ended up driving to the lake while charging my watch and proceeded to do my warm up while still charging the watch on a portable charger.

Did 1 k warm up with a few drills, leg swings, lunges, set out some cups of gatorade grabbed my watch which was up to 24% by now, hopped that was enough and took off.

## Kilometers [1] to [5]

It took a while to get the pacing right, I wanted to hit around 4:45-4:55 pace give or take. Not a pace I run at very often. My tempo is around 4:25-4:30 these days, easy runs around 5:15-5:45. Once I got there, I think I felt still a bit stiff and tight. Plus my shoe on my right foot was a bit loose, I could feel it sliding around. Do I stop and tighten in? No I decided to press on.

Felt though I was working a bit harder than I wanted to be and had some doubts over the sustainability of this pace.

I grabbed a gatorade cup at the 3k mark, which I had to make a slight deviation for and then I didnt really think it through, the cups I had were quite large and hard to drink from. Plus I had made it way too strong.

## Kilometers [6] to [10]

I started to feel good now pace wise, settled into a good rhythm. Until suddenly, I look down and my shoelaces are undone on my right foot! I press pause on my watch and tighten and double knot them on both feet. I probably make them a bit too tight and hope that continue to run will break them back in. I lose about a minute in doing that as well...

I'm able to quickly get back into a rhythm and the shoes do feel better after about half a k.

I grab another gatorade as well after lap 2, my stomach feels a bit funny. Maybe I'll just do every 2nd lap now on.

## Kilometers [11] to [15]

Hitting the halfway mark was a big boost. It's downhill from here. Well each k has a bit of up and down hill, hence a bit more variance than if it was all flat. I start producing a bit of phlegm, which I'm a bit conscious of during COVID 19. I make sure I spit in quiet bushy areas...  Not sure what the ettiqute is there...

Still feeling pretty good, legs a little heavy. I'm breathing in 2 steps out 2 steps.

## Kilometers [16] to [21.1]

As expected things get a bit tough here. I'm hanging out fro the last 5k and then the last 3k lap. Except it's a 2.88km course, so it's hard to predict when the last full lap will be. I try and do some calculations in my head to distract me. When I get to 5k to go, I feel relieved. But then i realize 5k is still a long way to go. It's 23-24 minutes of running!

I have a bit of an energy boost from somewhere (probably the gatorade) at the 18k mark, run a 4:33. But then I start puffing and realize I've got 3ks still to go... I thought maybe I could push for each of the last few k's but I cant keep this up. So I relax a bit and tell myself, stay steady and save it for the last k. That's basically what I do- I launch for the last k end up doing a 4:18 which I'm pretty happy with.

Final time is sub 1:40! But then when I add my shoe lace time, it blows back out.

All in all, I'm pretty happy and with another block of training next year and flat race conditions maybe could get close to 1:30.

## What's next?

Baby is due in a week and will have to cut back running a bit, especially as family cant visit due to COVID state borders closed.  Next year I want to run a marathon, maybe 3:30 could be a goal, depending on what shape I'm in, but even just finishing one I'd be stoked. I also want to see if I can get  a sub 40 10k.",t2_3ircww0i,False,,0,False,"1:40 half this morning, (13 minute PR!)",[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-racereport,0,,False,t3_ifjb1s,False,dark,0.95,,public,138,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Race Report,False,138,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598276646.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Race information&lt;/h2&gt;

* **Name:** Fuck it, may as well keep going half marathon
* **Date:** August 23,2020
* **Distance:** 21.2km
* **Location:** Montreal, QC
* **Time:** 2:35:24

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A | Run 15k| *Yes* |
| B | Keep going to 21k? Sure. Why not. | *Yes* |
| C | Acquire victory coffee &amp; breakfast sandwich  | *Yes* |


### Training
No real training plan. I run 30-35km a week with a longer run on Sundays, today just went a little longer than planned.

### Pre-race
Woke up, put on my gear, grabbed my water bottle and my phone, and took off. I did pack a couple of gu gel packets, sometimes I get that low blood sugar spinny feeling on longer runs so I like to have one on hand just in case.

### Race
It was a gorgeous, cool morning, about 20c and overcast. I ran slow, got into a good rhythm, and just kept going.

Everything felt really good up through about 19km, surprisingly so. No soreness, no fatigue, breathing was easy, stride felt great. I had to keep checking my pace to slow down, kept catching myself speeding up and I didn't want to push it so close to the end. At about that point, my feet started feeling it. I wore my NB Minimus, probably not the best choice for a half marathon. I find they're great up to about the 15km mark, then the lack of padding starts to make itself known.

### Post-race
I timed my run to finish about 250m from my favourite coffee shop, giving me a few minutes of walking to cool down before grabbing what was probably the best tasting flat white I've ever had. Seriously, the sound I made at that first sip was pornographic. That plus a breakfast sandwich were my reward on the walk home, about 1.5km, enough to let me cool down properly and get in some calories.

Now I'm flaked out on a comfortable chair with a bottle of water.

The race was cancelled yet again about a month ago, so I came on this forum and asked if I should run a virtual full.

,running,"Reposting because my previous title was not descriptive enough.

Hey everyone. I just ran four miles for the first time in over two months, but I'm not feeling great about it. At the beginning of quarantine and through about June, I was running 4-7 miles without a problem, but in the past couple of months I've found myself getting really tired after only about two miles. During this recent four miler, I had to stop every half mile to drink some water and catch my breath, which meant I finished the run at a very slow pace (about 12:00/mile). I averaged about 10:00/mile in the past. I've been chalking up the increased exhaustion and difficulty to the summer heat; I live in Chicago, and we've had a pretty hot, humid summer (like mid-upper 80s everyday). I'm really hoping that once it cools down I'll be able to get back into it, as I really feel terrible when I have to slow down or stop after only a couple of miles. It makes me feel like I'm crazy out of shape or something is wrong with me, since I KNOW I can do (and have done) better. There's nothing worse than setting out to accomplish something and not being able to do it.

I feel like this four mile run should have been way easier/faster, or I should have been able to go farther for longer. Has anyone experiences a rut like this? Where you just, for some reason, CAN'T do what you know you can do? How did you cope with it? What mental barriers did you have to break? I'm feeling really down on myself about this.

Additionally, I've been trying to supplement my workout routines since running has been so difficult lately. I've been doing a lot of Youtube full-body workouts (Pamela Reif, Chloe Ting) as well as HIIT with a jump rope, but I wonder if there's other exercises I can do to improve my running?

* **What?** Personal Time Trial
* **When?** 22 August 2020
* **How far?** 21km 


### Goals  
| Goal | Description | Completed? |  
|------|-------------|------------|  
| A |&lt; 2:30 | *Yes* |  
| B |Finish the distance | *Yes* |  


TL:DR - Did my first half marathon solo as part of a full marathon training plan; finished in  2:29:13 and was very happy.

### Background &amp; Training  
A quick background - I used to hate running with a passion since before 2019. I never quite enjoyed it, would rather play sports, and avoided it as much as I could. 

Long story short, Eliud Kipchoge's sub 2h marathon inspired me and after adopting the 80:20 rule, I found it a lot more enjoyable to run and set a full marathon as my goal. The longest I had ever ran previously (many years ago) was 10km.

I decided on Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Marathon plan as it seemed popular and well-reviewed. Most of the first half of 2020 was spent getting used to running 3 times, then eventually 4x a week, building up my weekly mileage to about 20-30km before starting on the Novice 1 plan proper in July. The plan calls for a half marathon distance in Week 8, so I decided to time-trial it and give it my best effort.

### Targets  
My easy pace during training was about 7:30/km or so, and I wanted to finish the full marathon at about 5hours, so my half marathon target ended up being under 2:30, or 7:07/km average. I had a dozen niggling injuries/pains throughout my training, ranging from foot pain, ankle soreness, calf issues, knee tightness, etc (which I'm working on by doing lots of hip / glute strengthening, single leg work, stretching/foamrolling, etc), so I was somewhat hesitant to push the pace to sub 7:00/km.

### Route

I live in Singapore, and my route was basically around the Marina Bay waterfront (to/fro loop). It is mostly but not entirely flat, with most of the elevation coming from ups/downs of bridges.

### Kilometers \[1\] to \[5\]  
I set off at what I thought was an easy relaxed pace - the first 5km was always when I was still shaking off any niggles and weird pains. Later on I found out I averaged 7:00/km for this segment though, so maybe it was too fast.  


### Kilometers \[5\] to \[10.5\]  
The early niggles had gone away, and things were feeling good. My feet occasionally had some repetitive impact discomfort at about 8km but it didn't flare up today. I popped a GU gel at 7km as planned. Caramel Macchiato is nice! Ave pace here was about 7:12/km, but felt comfortable. There was also more elevation here than in the first 5km.  

### Kilometers \[10.5\] to \[15\]  
10.5km was my turnaround point, and I was feeling GOOD at this stage. Nothing really hurt, feet were getting tired but growing numb too, so I recalled thinking 'I'm going to finish this!'. Popped the 2nd and last gel at 14km.  

### Kilometers \[16\] to \[21\]  
At 16km, I still felt good, so I decided to up the effort and try to go faster. Later on I realised even though I thought I put in more effort, my pace did not change, so it seems like I had just fatigued and the increased effort was just to maintain the pace. For the final 1km I went all out, but again, it wasn't as fast as I thought at about 7:03/km.  


Crossed the 21km mark at 2:29:13 and finished 21.15km at 2:30:14, no idea how to see my timing at 21.0975km but will take it as a sub 2:30!   


### What's Next? 

Next week is a stepback week; and the mileage will continue to build up as I work towards my full marathon. Can't imagine doing this distance twice... but then again I've never imagined being able to complete a 21km.  Also, think a sub 5 full marathon is impossible given this timing, probably 5+ will be realistic. Wish me luck!

&lt;p&gt;A quick background - I used to hate running with a passion since before 2019. I never quite enjoyed it, would rather play sports, and avoided it as much as I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, Eliud Kipchoge&amp;#39;s sub 2h marathon inspired me and after adopting the 80:20 rule, I found it a lot more enjoyable to run and set a full marathon as my goal. The longest I had ever ran previously (many years ago) was 10km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided on Hal Higdon&amp;#39;s Novice 1 Marathon plan as it seemed popular and well-reviewed. Most of the first half of 2020 was spent getting used to running 3 times, then eventually 4x a week, building up my weekly mileage to about 20-30km before starting on the Novice 1 plan proper in July. The plan calls for a half marathon distance in Week 8, so I decided to time-trial it and give it my best effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Targets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My easy pace during training was about 7:30/km or so, and I wanted to finish the full marathon at about 5hours, so my half marathon target ended up being under 2:30, or 7:07/km average. I had a dozen niggling injuries/pains throughout my training, ranging from foot pain, ankle soreness, calf issues, knee tightness, etc (which I&amp;#39;m working on by doing lots of hip / glute strengthening, single leg work, stretching/foamrolling, etc), so I was somewhat hesitant to push the pace to sub 7:00/km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Route&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Singapore, and my route was basically around the Marina Bay waterfront (to/fro loop). It is mostly but not entirely flat, with most of the elevation coming from ups/downs of bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kilometers [1] to [5]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set off at what I thought was an easy relaxed pace - the first 5km was always when I was still shaking off any niggles and weird pains. Later on I found out I averaged 7:00/km for this segment though, so maybe it was too fast.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kilometers [5] to [10.5]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early niggles had gone away, and things were feeling good. My feet occasionally had some repetitive impact discomfort at about 8km but it didn&amp;#39;t flare up today. I popped a GU gel at 7km as planned. Caramel Macchiato is nice! Ave pace here was about 7:12/km, but felt comfortable. There was also more elevation here than in the first 5km.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kilometers [10.5] to [15]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10.5km was my turnaround point, and I was feeling GOOD at this stage. Nothing really hurt, feet were getting tired but growing numb too, so I recalled thinking &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m going to finish this!&amp;#39;. Popped the 2nd and last gel at 14km.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Kilometers [16] to [21]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 16km, I still felt good, so I decided to up the effort and try to go faster. Later on I realised even though I thought I put in more effort, my pace did not change, so it seems like I had just fatigued and the increased effort was just to maintain the pace. For the final 1km I went all out, but again, it wasn&amp;#39;t as fast as I thought at about 7:03/km.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossed the 21km mark at 2:29:13 and finished 21.15km at 2:30:14, no idea how to see my timing at 21.0975km but will take it as a sub 2:30!   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week is a stepback week; and the mileage will continue to build up as I work towards my full marathon. Can&amp;#39;t imagine doing this distance twice... but then again I&amp;#39;ve never imagined being able to complete a 21km.  Also, think a sub 5 full marathon is impossible given this timing, probably 5+ will be realistic. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

,running,"Inspired by a comment on an earlier post, I asked my roommate to drive me about 11.5 miles out of town into bumfuck nowhere, Wyoming (okay, not super middle of nowhere, but WY is empty the moment you leave town). The only way to get back home would be to either run or hitchhike. 

I was pleasantly surprised at how nice of a run it was. I had never been down this road before and as a geologist I had a lovely time looking at all the exposed bedrock. I had a light edible beforehand and hardly noticed the first hour of the run, keeping about a 10:30 pace. I started a bit in the mountains, so the constant downhill certainly helped! 

After the first hour, I started to feel fatigued from the very heavy wildfire haze currently covering much of the western US. My motivation was dropping fast, but the one thing that kept me going was that I simply had no choice. Either I keep running, or I stop and wither in the sagebrush. Soon after, at around the 7 mile mark, I started to recognize where I was from previous long runs which gave me the focus to keep going. A brief 1 minute walk to catch my breath, and I was feeling very confident in my ability to finish strong. The little valley in my pace (below) was when I had to stop at a crosswalk. 

A day of recovery later, I would absolutely do this kind of run again and strongly recommend it to everyone who runs longer distances. Often, you will see new sights that are just too far to get to if you are going out and back, and at the very least it forces you to get the mileage in. There is no turning back early, thinking ""maybe this isn't my day.""

,running,"Today I run my first 15K! Thanks Reddit!!

I (F, 29) could only run for 20 minutes a few years ago. My mind would just set small goals and running had no much purpose for me. I wanted to like running but it didn't really sink in me.

In May I started running. My goals were not distances but time  I wanted to be able to be running for at least 30 minutes. So I started adding 5 mins when it felt good and I was running 45 mins for a few weeks. Then, I joined this awesome Reddit and I discovered Strava, so it was nice to see my runs in a map after doing them. I didn't really care about speed or records, I just wanted to keep moving, not stopping and running for more time. There is a good feeling behind knowing that you can be running away from a danger for this amount of time and whenever I wear my running gear I feel powerful  and big, although I'm only 1,55m / 5.1feet. It's amazing the power Running gives!

Then, thanks again to some runners in this Reddit I found out about ""Run with Hal"" and I settled that I wanted to run 15K on the 31st August. 

I have been running 2-4 times per week following the Run with Hal plan and having 15K as a goal for the 31st August. I always run the amount of time set on the plan but I always was faster than the planned speed (I usually run 6 to 6.30km/h depending the altitude) and the plan wanted me to do a 8km/h. 

My trick (again, learned thanks to many Reddit runners) was to slow down if I thought I was fast or not comfortable enough.

Go slow.
This tip makes wonders and kept me going easily. My knees, which hurt a bit at the beginning of my plan, now only hurt a bit once I've run for an hour (the good hurt kind of hurt) And my lungs are great except when it's too hot (40°C/104°F) and humid. To be honest, when I finish my runs I feel ok, I don't feel tired and as soon as I stop running I can breath properly like if I wasn't tired. Should I push myself to run harder? Maybe. But I don't want to push myself too much and start hating running. 

Today:

 I had to run 1h 48' so I knew I was going to do 15K some time on my run. I did my way up a mountain that I always do but the way down that I always take was closed so I had 2 options: go back my way and down the mountain or keep going up the mountain. I chose the second and just kept running up the mountain. I was veeery slow but it was great. 

- Distance: 15,84 kilometres
- Time: 1.54h
- Average speed: 7,16/km
- Altitude run: 266m
- Music: Gaga + Sia (I also owe my runnings to these women) also I cannot run without music yet because I think that if I listen to myself breathing my mind will think that I'm too tired (which I'm not) and my mind won't be that strong to keep running 

If you have reached this point, thank you so much. I also owe this run to you all.


I'm afraid I will come back to this Reddit to keep reading you all and asking you tons of questions because I need to learn a lot from you yet.

I wish you all happy runs!


* Some day I will write what running means to me, but today I just wanted to write that thanks to you all I have kept running and that it's great to have this support that we give each other.

* Some day I will also write about how horrible it is to run in the city because I just know some men will say things at me. And even if I love running in the path and mountain a part of me is sad to know that I don't like running in the city because some men will say things   that nobody wants to listen.

Edit: as my post hasn't been very focused on data and accurate terms I'll leave the next information here just in case it helps someone: after the run, a shower and a light dinner (pumpkin pure/soup) I slept like a baby. However I woke up once during the night because I couldn't feel my legs and in my dream I thought I was paralyzed because  I couldn't feel them at all, as I didn't have always anymore, so I woke up and remembered that it might be because of exhaustion so, half-asleep I made sure I could feel them by moving a toe. Not more, just one toe because I felt them heavy, and went back to sleep with a very  happy feeling because of this post-15K exhaustion. Today I haven't had any pain or hurt at all. I just feel my legs very strong and my lungs very open. (Sorry for the lack of accuracy).

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some day I will write what running means to me, but today I just wanted to write that thanks to you all I have kept running and that it&amp;#39;s great to have this support that we give each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some day I will also write about how horrible it is to run in the city because I just know some men will say things at me. And even if I love running in the path and mountain a part of me is sad to know that I don&amp;#39;t like running in the city because some men will say things   that nobody wants to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: as my post hasn&amp;#39;t been very focused on data and accurate terms I&amp;#39;ll leave the next information here just in case it helps someone: after the run, a shower and a light dinner (pumpkin pure/soup) I slept like a baby. However I woke up once during the night because I couldn&amp;#39;t feel my legs and in my dream I thought I was paralyzed because  I couldn&amp;#39;t feel them at all, as I didn&amp;#39;t have always anymore, so I woke up and remembered that it might be because of exhaustion so, half-asleep I made sure I could feel them by moving a toe. Not more, just one toe because I felt them heavy, and went back to sleep with a very  happy feeling because of this post-15K exhaustion. Today I haven&amp;#39;t had any pain or hurt at all. I just feel my legs very strong and my lungs very open. (Sorry for the lack of accuracy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to express is that it was worthy and that if I could do it I have no doubt you can do it too!&lt;/p&gt;

### Training
I have been a runner for 8 years and prior to this, I had completed 10 half marathons. I decided to train for a full after I had a half canceled in April as my “quarantine project” since I had a lot more time to run while working from home. I utilized the Hal Higdon Novice 1 plan and picked it up from after the half marathon mark starting the last week of March. I ended up cycling through the plan a couple of times since races kept getting canceled, but finally found one that wasn’t canceled! I ended up running two 18 milers, a 19, and a 20 during training. I also strength trained by doing a megaformer class twice a week and did some hiking as cross training. 

### Pre-race
This race had a really creative setup in order to allow for social distancing. The race was held over 3 days and runners had to sign up for a 5 minute starting block which was limited to 8 runners every 5 minutes. All aid stations were grab and go bottled products. I signed up for the 5:30 AM Sunday spot to be able to run as early in the morning as possible! 

Packet pickup was the day before the race at an outdoor booth, and to limit touch points, they also distributed medals and finisher shirts at pick up. The night before the race, I had a dinner of rice and steelhead trout and went to bed around 8. I woke up at 2:30 on race day and had my typical pre-race banana, bagel, and peanut butter along with some coffee, Powerade, and water. The goal was to start running as soon as you got to the starting line to avoid congregating, so we showed up to the starting line, I used the toilet, and off I went!

### Race
Holy hills Batman. This race was extremely hilly, with more immediate inclines and declines than I expected from the elevation map. The course itself was well marked, and consisted of two out and back sections, with the start and finish line somewhere in between the two. I started out feeling great, despite the hills. The aid stations for the marathon only section were about 4 miles apart, so I did end up carrying my own water and fuel to supplement. I tried to bank as much time on the downhills as possible to make up for the uphills I knew I would have on the way back. 

The course itself was beautiful with great views of the lake. The benefit of a socially distanced run was that there was no initial bobbing and weaving which was great—my watch ended up being right in sync with the mile markers. 

The race utilized the race joy app to try to make up for the limited to no spectators along the course. Through the app, people can track you and send cheers, and it gave turn by turn guidance of the course. Unfortunately, my app stopped working about 16 miles in, so I missed a lot of the updates and cheers. The app is a cool idea, but seems a bit buggy.

It was definitely different than a typical race environment. During the marathon only leg, I saw very few other runners, and only a couple of spectators (really one group that was following someone running near me to replenish water/fuel given the limited aid stations). The grab and go drinks are totally understandable, but it was then awkward having to carry a full bottle for the next several miles. I actually ended up walking around mile 18 in order to dump water into my hydration pack because it was so difficult to run holding the bottle. The plus side was that I was able to stay plenty hydrated! I also took in a half pack of sport beans every couple of miles, and subbed a half of a honey stinger waffle at 12 and 18 miles. 

Everyone warned me about the last 10K being its own race, but wow was I not ready. The extended hill also didn’t help. I did allow myself to walk for 30 seconds to a minute at the mile marks during the last 10K (probably walked a total of .2-.3 miles), but I did at least manage to never stop completely and ran the final 1.5 miles straight. I definitely felt the wall and had some lightheadedness—it really took everything in me to just keep my legs running and I don’t think I could have gone any faster if I had wanted to. Sub-4 had been a huuuge stretch goal for me anyway, so I was okay with just finishing strong at that point, and I still blew away my “real” goals in the end (though I do think I could have broken 4 on a flatter course and/or with a “real” race environment—who can say?). Still, I was grateful to see my family at the 25.9 mile mark, and ecstatic to finally cross the finish line!

### Post-race
Elevated my legs, took some pics, then came home to shower and eat. About to take a glorious and much needed nap! I am quite sore (no surprise there!)

Edit to add:
Apparently I won my division!! There were only 12 people in it, but still—I’ll take it!!

&lt;td&gt;2:12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a runner for 8 years and prior to this, I had completed 10 half marathons. I decided to train for a full after I had a half canceled in April as my “quarantine project” since I had a lot more time to run while working from home. I utilized the Hal Higdon Novice 1 plan and picked it up from after the half marathon mark starting the last week of March. I ended up cycling through the plan a couple of times since races kept getting canceled, but finally found one that wasn’t canceled! I ended up running two 18 milers, a 19, and a 20 during training. I also strength trained by doing a megaformer class twice a week and did some hiking as cross training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This race had a really creative setup in order to allow for social distancing. The race was held over 3 days and runners had to sign up for a 5 minute starting block which was limited to 8 runners every 5 minutes. All aid stations were grab and go bottled products. I signed up for the 5:30 AM Sunday spot to be able to run as early in the morning as possible! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packet pickup was the day before the race at an outdoor booth, and to limit touch points, they also distributed medals and finisher shirts at pick up. The night before the race, I had a dinner of rice and steelhead trout and went to bed around 8. I woke up at 2:30 on race day and had my typical pre-race banana, bagel, and peanut butter along with some coffee, Powerade, and water. The goal was to start running as soon as you got to the starting line to avoid congregating, so we showed up to the starting line, I used the toilet, and off I went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy hills Batman. This race was extremely hilly, with more immediate inclines and declines than I expected from the elevation map. The course itself was well marked, and consisted of two out and back sections, with the start and finish line somewhere in between the two. I started out feeling great, despite the hills. The aid stations for the marathon only section were about 4 miles apart, so I did end up carrying my own water and fuel to supplement. I tried to bank as much time on the downhills as possible to make up for the uphills I knew I would have on the way back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course itself was beautiful with great views of the lake. The benefit of a socially distanced run was that there was no initial bobbing and weaving which was great—my watch ended up being right in sync with the mile markers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race utilized the race joy app to try to make up for the limited to no spectators along the course. Through the app, people can track you and send cheers, and it gave turn by turn guidance of the course. Unfortunately, my app stopped working about 16 miles in, so I missed a lot of the updates and cheers. The app is a cool idea, but seems a bit buggy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely different than a typical race environment. During the marathon only leg, I saw very few other runners, and only a couple of spectators (really one group that was following someone running near me to replenish water/fuel given the limited aid stations). The grab and go drinks are totally understandable, but it was then awkward having to carry a full bottle for the next several miles. I actually ended up walking around mile 18 in order to dump water into my hydration pack because it was so difficult to run holding the bottle. The plus side was that I was able to stay plenty hydrated! I also took in a half pack of sport beans every couple of miles, and subbed a half of a honey stinger waffle at 12 and 18 miles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone warned me about the last 10K being its own race, but wow was I not ready. The extended hill also didn’t help. I did allow myself to walk for 30 seconds to a minute at the mile marks during the last 10K (probably walked a total of .2-.3 miles), but I did at least manage to never stop completely and ran the final 1.5 miles straight. I definitely felt the wall and had some lightheadedness—it really took everything in me to just keep my legs running and I don’t think I could have gone any faster if I had wanted to. Sub-4 had been a huuuge stretch goal for me anyway, so I was okay with just finishing strong at that point, and I still blew away my “real” goals in the end (though I do think I could have broken 4 on a flatter course and/or with a “real” race environment—who can say?). Still, I was grateful to see my family at the 25.9 mile mark, and ecstatic to finally cross the finish line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevated my legs, took some pics, then came home to shower and eat. About to take a glorious and much needed nap! I am quite sore (no surprise there!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit to add:
Apparently I won my division!! There were only 12 people in it, but still—I’ll take it!!&lt;/p&gt;

I wake up at 4:30am every Sunday so I can get half my run done before the sun is fully up and I go slow, averaging 13min/mile. It’s conversation pace for me, my husband rides his bike alongside me and we chat the whole time so I don’t think my issue is pace.

[Virtual Race Teaser](https://youtu.be/6hOza0OOS8s)

This is a pretty interesting concept for a virtual race/challenge.

What I think sets this apart from all other virtual races I've seen so far is that it offers a ""virtual tour"" of the entire course from start to finish with past footage of previous years races.

Most virtual races will offer bling and a shirt but it is really missing a unqiue experience which I think this may be able to provide.

### Training
I haven't raced since late January right before the virus started shutting everything down here. I also fell out of training and became largely sedentary for three months, where I lost all the gains I made last year. I started getting into the habit of running again in late May and joined a half marathon training program July. It mostly consisted of recovery runs with weekly long runs or tempo runs. Currently I'm in week 9 of the program, so I haven't reaped all the benefits yet but I this race was convenient for the family to take a trip down to see family, so it was more or less a practice race for me ^^

### Race strategy
I just wanted to go at a constant pace and not burn out by the 14th kilometer like I usually do xD 

### Pre-race
Unfortunately we did not get good quality sleep because the B&amp;B we were staying at was one big hell hole. Woke up at four feeling sick and had to force myself to eat at least a bagel. Could not manage anything else after that.
We also booked our accommodation at the wrong place and had to drive ten kilometers to the event. After storing our belongings, I was suddenly hit with a bad case of stomach pains. By the time I left the bathroom I had three minutes for a quick joint warm-up before lining up at the start line.

### Race
As if nothing else could go wrong...this wasn't the race I thought I signed up for. I mentioned my pacing strategy was to be constant. That's because I thought it was mostly a flat race. In reality the organizers changed the route from previous years and the elevation was never constant. It would go up for five hundred meters, be flat for fifty then go down again.


### Kilometer 1 [#]
I experienced for the first time in my life what it feels like to throw up when you run too fast.


### Kilometers [#]2 to [#]6
Mostly a small hill. I got passed by almost everybody  after slowing down in the first kilometer and it was the hardest thing not to just throw in the towel. I felt so awful and the hill didn't help. I was shook.

### Kilometer [#] 7
I have accepted I will not smash my PB today. Somehow, this is reassuring. It feels relaxing to know I'm just running this race for the fun of it.


### Kilometers [#]7 to the end
A very big hill. Every time I thought it was the end of the hill climb, there would be a decline and we would start climbing again. This felt more like torture than anything. Im running on nothing beyond 7km, only the promise of breakfast waiting for me at the finish line.

### Kilometer [#] 8
I thought I was dying on the hills but turns out other people are also dying. I began passing a tonne of people. Am I running too fast? I check my watch. I've slowed down.

### Kilometer [#] 9
Unfortunately I am passing even more people now. This is bad for me mentally because now I start considering whether I can pass enough people to secure a place in my age group. Physically, I'm feeling great. That 12.5k uphill training session suddenly seems like its paying off

### Kilometer [#] 20.7-21.1
My legs have been feeling fine until this point. Suddenly I have hit the dreaded wall. How can i convince myself there's only one more lap around the track left? I can't. I stumble to the finishing line 2.5 minutes after my goal time and 4 minutes earlier than my PB.


### Thoughts
It's a bit of a silly report but tbh I legit don't remember too much of it. Is that normal? All I remember was my chest burning as I tried to run as fast as I can without burning myself out too fast. The rest is a blur.

Although I have usually stuck to the training plan given to me, lately I've been throwing some tantrums and skipping out on some of the training sessions. This race has really taught me that I must absolutely go back to doing what I am told to do. In the past I would have stopped and walked some of these hills, or bonked at 14k; this time, I felt good for most of the race except for the last mile where I just could not increase my pace anymore. So, as much as I'm hating interval and tempo runs right now, I've learned that people do them for a good reason. I will absolutely learn to love doing them from now on.

Given the circumstances (poor sleep, poor fueling, stomach pains, no warm-up, the list goes on) Im almost certain it could be worse. It could have been rainy OR so sunny I died of heatstroke 100m from the finish line. Thankfully it was relatively cool and cloudy. And I'm still proud of my time. I didn't make my target goal, but I did break my PB, and that's worth celebrating for me.

### What's next?
I also managed to win some cash. It was a small race, mind you, but I was the fifth girl to cross the line and first in my age group. I'm walking off with $40 USD and unfortunately rule it is that any cash won during training needs to go back to the team. I'm thinking of treating them to some local cheesecake next session. What do you guys think?

,running,"Hey everyone! 👋

I'm a new(b) runner. Due to COVID, I've recently decided to take on Peloton's marathon training. I just finished up week 3 with a long run today; it's the longest I've ever run and was a blast (13km).

The reason I'm here is because I wanted to see if there was any advice on my training.

Prior to week 3, I had just been running as best I could and trying to keep a decent (for me) pace. I have a friend who was supporting me on Strava. We talk often so he asked me about my heart rate, saying how it was quite high during my runs.

He's pretty experienced when it comes to training and loves to use data to train. He introduced me to zone training and said that people often refer to training in my zone as ""junk miles"". Essentially, my heart rate was quite high. My training was not effective.

This week (week 3 out of 18) I started doing zone training. After a bit of quick research (and feedback from my friend) I started shooting for zone 2 during my runs. It's been a night and day difference. I come out of my runs feeling a lot less beat down. I can run much longer.

Working in zone 2 has been great but **I am so darn slow**. I guess I'm just looking for reassurance. I know I'm *training* now, not just *running*. But still, my ego hurts every time someone blazes past me.

Is there hope for me? Will my pace ever improve?

### Pre-race
My goal I´ve gotten a sub 40 min 10k before and even a 19:00 flat 5k in very late may so i was fairly confident that i could pull out a sub 40 min 10k at Helsinki Pre-race It involved some light jogging of about 1,5 km, with some stretching and warming up, It poured a lot a few hours ago and light rains would hit here and there. It was rather perfect it seemed with no rain until the last 10 minutes. Weather was cloudy and light rain at around 20 C.

### Race
1 KM The suspension was killing as the countdown began to go down from 60 seconds to 0, it went from light rain to less rain until, bam everyone began to run and as soon as we went off it began to really pour down on us, to the point it was actually difficult for me to breathe and see.

2 KM it continued to pour and i eased into my pace, raining continued and it was still pouring like thunder kind of stuff.

3 KM It was still the same, not much changed i still felt good and my negative split was going good, although the heavy rain did start to affect me.

4 KM I was beginning to have issues, it was rather slippery now and water everywhere, I saw a lot of marathoners look miserable slow like a turtle. I was also realizing the route had some extreme tight turns at times which i´m not used to at all and would kill my momentum

5 KM Between from 4 to 5 KM I hit some smalls hills which isnt a big deal if i were to run a marathon, but man i swear those hills were an absolute pace killer and drained me more.

6 KM I was beginning to dread it and my energy lvls were low, this was when i realized i wasn´t gonna sub 40, but thats okay i accepted that fact and would do my absolute best.

7 KM This is probably the 2nd least KM in a 10 km race, youre so close but so far to the finish and your mind and body is starting to really struggle, by now it hasn´t rained since around 5 KM mark i would guess. But some of the sandy/pavements were still really slippery with constant tight turns.

8 KM My least favorite KM is for sure the 8 KM where I start to feel awful and hate it, my lungs are screaming and yet i have to somehow find more in me.

9 KM to finish By this point throughout my run i was hanging onto a runner with dear life in the distance and i made by best to stay as close as possible by giving my best, the last 300 meters or so i was booking it and i would hit the finish line using everything i have, at that time i didnt quite feel it but the very moment i stopped my legs just went all spaghetti on me.


### Post-race
I was a bit bummed out not getting a sub 40, but I know that I can get one. The most important thing about the race here however is that i was able to experience the race and the people, I loved the energy and most importantly when i was at my lowest morale and struggle i was able to triumph over myself and not give in an inch in and that is what i loved about it the most, me overcoming obstacles in the race and my mental struggle in it.

A fat obese like me would have never imagined doing something like this 2,5 years ago. Now i´m a pretty good runner, and i´m excited to do Helsinki City Double where i will be running 63,3 km hopefully being the top 1-5. This is the first time where i dont PB a run, but thats okay i decided i wanted to share my achievements of running and the joy and struggle of it, as someone i heard once tell me, if you make friends with pain you will never be alone. This was my 2nd race ever, my first being a full marathon last year. Definitely a learning experience.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal I´ve gotten a sub 40 min 10k before and even a 19:00 flat 5k in very late may so i was fairly confident that i could pull out a sub 40 min 10k at Helsinki Pre-race It involved some light jogging of about 1,5 km, with some stretching and warming up, It poured a lot a few hours ago and light rains would hit here and there. It was rather perfect it seemed with no rain until the last 10 minutes. Weather was cloudy and light rain at around 20 C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 KM The suspension was killing as the countdown began to go down from 60 seconds to 0, it went from light rain to less rain until, bam everyone began to run and as soon as we went off it began to really pour down on us, to the point it was actually difficult for me to breathe and see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 KM it continued to pour and i eased into my pace, raining continued and it was still pouring like thunder kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 KM It was still the same, not much changed i still felt good and my negative split was going good, although the heavy rain did start to affect me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 KM I was beginning to have issues, it was rather slippery now and water everywhere, I saw a lot of marathoners look miserable slow like a turtle. I was also realizing the route had some extreme tight turns at times which i´m not used to at all and would kill my momentum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 KM Between from 4 to 5 KM I hit some smalls hills which isnt a big deal if i were to run a marathon, but man i swear those hills were an absolute pace killer and drained me more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 KM I was beginning to dread it and my energy lvls were low, this was when i realized i wasn´t gonna sub 40, but thats okay i accepted that fact and would do my absolute best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 KM This is probably the 2nd least KM in a 10 km race, youre so close but so far to the finish and your mind and body is starting to really struggle, by now it hasn´t rained since around 5 KM mark i would guess. But some of the sandy/pavements were still really slippery with constant tight turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 KM My least favorite KM is for sure the 8 KM where I start to feel awful and hate it, my lungs are screaming and yet i have to somehow find more in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 KM to finish By this point throughout my run i was hanging onto a runner with dear life in the distance and i made by best to stay as close as possible by giving my best, the last 300 meters or so i was booking it and i would hit the finish line using everything i have, at that time i didnt quite feel it but the very moment i stopped my legs just went all spaghetti on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Post-race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit bummed out not getting a sub 40, but I know that I can get one. The most important thing about the race here however is that i was able to experience the race and the people, I loved the energy and most importantly when i was at my lowest morale and struggle i was able to triumph over myself and not give in an inch in and that is what i loved about it the most, me overcoming obstacles in the race and my mental struggle in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fat obese like me would have never imagined doing something like this 2,5 years ago. Now i´m a pretty good runner, and i´m excited to do Helsinki City Double where i will be running 63,3 km hopefully being the top 1-5. This is the first time where i dont PB a run, but thats okay i decided i wanted to share my achievements of running and the joy and struggle of it, as someone i heard once tell me, if you make friends with pain you will never be alone. This was my 2nd race ever, my first being a full marathon last year. Definitely a learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

,running,"* First attempt in Mid-April: approx. 25 minutes
* A couple days ago in Mid-August: 19 minutes and 40 seconds


My training plan was flexible but generally looked like:

*   2 to 3 runs per week - 1 run long (7-10K) and 1 or 2 tempo/threshold runs (5-7k)
* Soccer - 1 or 2 times per week 
* Gym - 2 or 3 times per week 
* 1 dedicated rest day - zero activity 


NGL, pretty happy with the improvement and the 19:40 PB. Here's my learnings for anyone shooting for sub 20:

*   Don't stress too much about running 40KM+ a week - people on this subreddit put too much emphasis on heavy mileage IMO. You CAN improve quick with only 2 or 3 runs per week
* Each run doesn't need to be faster than the last but you should see/feel improvement every fortnight 
* Your 2 or 3 runs per week should be steady pace (just beyond conversational level) with bursts of tough threshold running 
* These bursts will help your mental fortitude - for example, see if you can beat your 1K PB during a tempo run
* Do leg day at the gym - life saver on your joints

,running,"I just finished my 20th run of the summer, and I'm especially proud of this because I've been using a walking stick for balance since 2017. 

I live with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that has causes fatigue, mobility problems, and cardiovascular issues. I used to be very active, but one by one I've had to give up every sport or dance I've ever tried. Through a combination of symptom management and pure luck, I regained some mobility this year. So I decided to see how far I could push my progress.

Here's what worked:

In addition to being a great way to share encouragement and support, running with my roommates also helped me feel more secure because I knew they wouldn't ditch me if I fell. They also introduced me to some pretty great running music! I've since gained confidence and have been running alone, but starting out with friends was definitely the right move.

**Keep a radius:** I always try to keep a radius around my house and I always, always, ALWAYS bring my inhaler with me. If anything were to happen, I'm able to walk a shorter distance home with less risk of injury. The longest run I've done was about 7 kilometers, but I was never further than 2-ish kilometers from my front door.

**Only run when it feels right:** I only run when I feel up to it. A lot of people champion the ""show up no matter what"" mentality, but I consider my flexibility the way I ""show up no matter what"" for my health. Joints in pain from sleeping wrong? I won't run that morning, even if I'd planned on it. Body feels fine, but I'm just not in the right headspace? I'll skip the run and see how I feel the next day. This helps me avoid overuse injuries, and it keeps running from becoming a chore. Even with this inconsistent approach, I'm averaging \~1 run per week. That's a number I feel proud of.

**Every run is a success:**  I alternate between bursts of running and walking on every single one of my runs. I used to feel ashamed of how slow I am. But I realized that I am not in competition with anyone else. I'm not even in competition with my past self. I try to see every run as an exercise in self-improvement. Even if my distance is shorter or my time is slower than the run before, my past and future self are both cheering me on.

**Plan for a LOT of recovery time:** I don't think I've ever had a runner's high in my life! When I get home from a run, I lie flat on the floor for a while to help everything stabilize. Then it's water and electrolytes as soon as I can. I also try to get plenty of sleep the night before a run, and arrange to take a nap at some point after. Fatigue does not mess around, so I find rest is the most important factor in maintaining a successful routine.

And that's how I'm doing it! I hope you find these tips helpful, but this definitely isn't a one-size-fits-all situation. Everyone has different needs and circumstances. It's also important to note that exercise is NOT curing my Ehlers-Danlos. My symptoms had to improve by an order of magnitude before I could even attempt this. I'm still not entirely sure how that progress happened, but I'm grateful for the chance to enjoy being active again.

,running,"Hi thanks for looking at my post! So I used to be on the cross country team. My fastest time was 6:30 min per mile (4:02 per km), and on average I would run a 7 min mile (4:20 per km). We ran about 35 miles per week and I was really enjoying it. 

But then I got an injury about a year ago so I took a break from running. I started running again about 2 months ago, but I’m stuck at 8:30 min miles (5:16 per km). I know that it’s going to take a while to get back into shape, but I’m really hating running right now. I run 5 (8 km) miles, 3 days a week. I’d say that this is moderately hard for me. It’s not extreme, but it’s definitely easy. 

I’m wondering if I should slow down, maybe to 9 min per mile so I can enjoy running again. I miss feeling invincible when I run. Now I’m just tired and out of breath and hating every second of it. 

I eventually want to rejoin the cross country team and run faster, but my ultimate goal is just to be healthy and enjoy running again. 

Ps. I never listen to anything while I run but I’m considering it. Do you think that listening to something helps you to enjoy running more?

Having a goal to strive towards makes things more enjoyable for me so I have settled upon 5-miles in 30 minutes after 4 months of training. I know it is very ambitious so I would be extremely grateful for your advice. 

Right now, I am able to run 15 laps (3.75 miles) in 30 minutes. I did that on a quarter mile track this past Thursday and it was very difficult. I think the following changes might make 5-miles in 30 minutes possible: 1) losing 30 pounds; 2) making a serious improvement in cardiovascular fitness since I am now just starting out; 3) improving running form; and 4) getting mentally tougher and gaining the ability to push myself harder. I only want to be able to run 5-miles in 30 minutes just once after going all out before the year is out. It's not something I expect I'll be able to do anytime I want. 

Any advice on how I should structure my training would be great. I am only able to run 3x/week. Should I just go for the same max-effort 30-minute run each time? Or should i do something slightly different each day? Perhaps it's not necessary to go as hard as I can each time? Any and all advice is welcome.

,running,"DISCLAIMER: having fallen foul of rule 7 and had my painstakingly typed message unceremoniously deleted, I have modified it slightly and reposted in the hope it is allowed to stay this time. I am not seeking medical advice, merely a discussion surrounding my knee problems and similar problems others may be experiencing and what they are doing about it. 

I started running a little late in life. I was 40 when I started doing my local ParkRun five years ago. My first ever 5k was 32 minutes, within 6 months I'd got that down to a respectable 26:30. Initially, I just did the weekly ParkRun but soon realised I needed to do at least 3 x 5k runs per week if I wanted to improve my time. However, in early 2016 (around 9-10 months after I started running) I began to experience pain in both knees - in particular when walking up or down stairs. I ignored it at first as it tended to disappear a couple of days after a run and was never painful during a run.

As time progressed, the pain became more frequent and was eventually present during my runs too. Notably, my left knee is much better than my right. I went to see an osteopath who advised me to stop running for 4-6 weeks, ice my knees three times a day and do a variety of regular stretching (up to this point I had never warmed up or done any kind of stretching either before or after my runs).

The ice and pulling my leg up to my butt and holding for 30 seconds (repeated several times a day, every day) appeared to keep things in check for a while. I never did take a break from running, as was recommended. My knees were not perfect but the stabbing pain in the kneecaps was only occurring for a day or so after a 5k run then it would wear off.

In the past year or so I attempted to try a 10k run and foolishly did 10k straight off, without any gradual increase. And both my knees sure knew about it immediately after. It made both of them really sore for several weeks. This time the ice and stretching didn't really seem to help. I was still running a 5k every 2-3 days so eventually gave in and rested for just over a week. I saw an immediate improvement. For the first time in 3-4 years I could walk up and down stairs without any stabbing pains.

After my brief rest, I started running again and within a week, the pain returned as bad as it was before - although once again, far worse in my right knee. The left knee was barely noticeable and seemed to recover much quicker but the right knee has been a continual thorn in my side. More recently I thought I would try another break and rested for a full week. As before, my knees felt like brand new and when I did my next 5k it was the first time in several years that I ran without any pain at all and had no pain after the run. But as soon as I upped my runs to 3 per week once more, things went back to the way they were.

I've increased my stretching, taken up some cycling to complement the running and to give a workout to the other leg muscles. I've continued to ice both knees every evening for 30 minutes and I invested in a foam roller and roll my calves, glutes, inner thigh and ITB several times a week but nothing other than a total cessation from running seems to help. The ice can keep things manageable but never cures it.

I really don't want to stop running completely for 4-6 weeks but I've also reached the point where the pain in my right knee is uncomfortable and prevents me from enjoying my runs.

The osteopath said it was inflation around the patella casing the pain. Who else suffers this way and what exercises, stretching, rolling, or other activities are you going to combat it?

I should also point out I am a mild over-pronator and am on my third pair of running shoes since 2015. I started off with some Adidas neutral shoes with orthotic insoles, which were pretty good. My second pair were another pair of Adidas neutrals, with the same orthotics. My latest pair bought last summer are Brooks Adrenaline GTS 19s stability shoe but without the orthotics. I bought these as they were recommended for knee pain but didn't seem to make any difference - so I have ruled out my shoes being the root cause of the problem. Incidentally, the Brooks gave my a new pain on my left achilles tendon and blisters on both heels, neither of which I had experienced before. At the risk of going off on a tangent, I am thinking of getting some Asics Gel Kayano 27's when I next change them (I replace them every 12-18 months or so, or every 1000km in my case).

As long as I spend at least an hour and a half running every day, and I listen to epic fantasy audiobooks to keep myself distracted and not thinking about what new things could go wrong this year, maybe I can keep sane enough to live through 2020.

**Edit**: as requested, I scrolled through my Audible history and here are some of the audiobooks that have worked well for me recently:

* Just about anything BrandoSando, most recently Stormlight Archive and Skyward
* Dresden files (Jim Butcher - I'm only about 8 books in currently)
* Ancillary Justice trilogy (Ann Leckie)
* The Interdepndency trilogy (John Scalzi)
* Gideon the Ninth (Tamsyn Muir - I have the sequel but haven't read it yet)
* Gentlemen Bastards (Scott Lynch)
* The Expanse (James S.A.

### Background
I started this spring/summer not knowing a PB from a PB&amp;J. When I first began running, I literally could not run more than 1/4 mile without running out of breath, and I had no concept of pacing. I would be short of breath and felt like my heart and lungs were going to come out my mouth at the end of a run.

### Training
I guess you could say I've been training for this since COVID hit. I had started running only on the weekends, until I heard a friend of mine 4 years younger than me nearly died of a heart attack. His cardiologist said, ""If you weren't in good shape because of fitness, you wouldn't have survived the surgery.""

### Pre-race
I run fasted. I just recently switched from my New Balance Vazee Pace shoes (yes, they're that old - from 2016) to New Balance FreshFoam Tempos. I have been walking in them all week to break them in, and I figured it was time to jump into the deep end and get these bad boys some action on the asphalt.

I got up a bit early to attend my weekly (virtual) AA Meeting, via Zoom, like I do each Saturday. I downed a bottle of water, signed off at the end of the meeting, KT-taped up my callus on my right foot, got out the door and promptly realized that I forgot to ""Band-aid"" my nips (yep, fellas - it's a thing). I figured hey, if I bleed, I bleed (I did not bleed). Off I went.

### Race
While I've already ""run/walked"" several 10ks around my neighborhood, I've never run the whole way. I wanted to build endurance. This was actually supposed to be a recovery run, followed by a bit quicker run. I started out running around a 13-minute mile. I had to force myself to run that slow, to keep my heart rate down. It was weird.

Once I got my first 5k in, I started to push. Surprisingly, I wasn't at all tired or thirsty, and I got a second wind around mile 4. I almost felt like I had literally just started the beginning of my run over; my breathing was fine, I could literally talk without labored breathing, and I had barely broken a sweat. 

That's when the fun ended. I decided to try to keep my heart rate ~90% of MHR, or in my case, &lt;159 bpm. While my legs and knees thanked me for the new cushy shoes, my heart and lungs weren't so happy about my decision to push things. I began to pray for the sun to go back behind the clouds, to cool the air a bit. Surprisingly, my prayers were answered and the temp felt like it dropped a few degrees, the sun stopped blazing and I felt a nice cool breeze.

I began to check my watch every 15 seconds or so, and was whining to myself about ""how I must have gone further than this stupid thing is saying. It must be off."" Notsomuch. 

I finally approached the 6.4-mile mark, went a bit further than the watch said (my Vivoactive 3 Music's GPS is sometimes short) just to make sure I had it in the bag. I walked the rest of the way home.

### Post-race
Walking up to my driveway, my water bottle had a Post-it where my daughter reminded me that ""I thought you were going to run with me......"" I simply assumed that because she saw me in my running clothes, and that I walked downstairs, and that she was eating in front of the TV, she had changed her mind. I won't assume that again: she's 30 and living with us, and times with family (although we see each other around the clock) are precious.

I have guzzled more water/electrolytes/BCAAs in one sitting than I do in a full day since hobbling back in the house. I have never sweated more in my entire life. 

### What's next?
A faster 10k.

In March 2019 I fell walking on some ice and suffered a degree 2 torn hamstring, took 9 months completely off of running (with PT, cross-training, chiropractics, etc) and ran first steps in January 2020.  Worked up to some solid 800 pace work this summer but hamstring still bites me when I do easy distance running. I have worked out a training plan with my coach that I believe will be ideal for load management while still progressing, but I’m just worried about the results I may get.  I usually do ~65 miles/week during base and ~35-40 during peak time.

**Plan for base work:**

Lift Tues/Thurs/Sat

Mon: Aerobic run ~6-7 miles

Tue: Tempo ~4 miles, 4 miles easy

Wed: BOOST antigravity treadmill 45-60 min

Thur: Max velocity day

Fri: Varied mile pace workout

Sat: 90 min swim

Sun: Off/shakeout run


**TOTAL: ~30 miles running, 150 min cross-train**


**Plan for peak season:**


Lift Tues/Thurs


Mon: Aerobic run ~4-5 miles

Tue: Varied 400-800 pace work

Wed: BOOST antigravity treadmill 30-45 min

Thur: Max velocity day or hills

Fri: Varied interval pace work

Sat: 90 min swim

Sun: Off/shakeout run


**TOTAL: ~20 miles running, 120 min cross-train**


Will this be enough mileage? Will this plan contribute to breaking 1:50? I am traditionally a power-based athlete that trains a lot of race-specific running. Please help, any advice is welcome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for base work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lift Tues/Thurs/Sat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mon: Aerobic run ~6-7 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tue: Tempo ~4 miles, 4 miles easy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wed: BOOST antigravity treadmill 45-60 min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thur: Max velocity day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fri: Varied mile pace workout&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sat: 90 min swim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun: Off/shakeout run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOTAL: ~30 miles running, 150 min cross-train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for peak season:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lift Tues/Thurs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mon: Aerobic run ~4-5 miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tue: Varied 400-800 pace work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wed: BOOST antigravity treadmill 30-45 min&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thur: Max velocity day or hills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fri: Varied interval pace work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sat: 90 min swim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun: Off/shakeout run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOTAL: ~20 miles running, 120 min cross-train&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this be enough mileage? Will this plan contribute to breaking 1:50? I am traditionally a power-based athlete that trains a lot of race-specific running. Please help, any advice is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Some additional notes, I train at 6000 ft elevation, will do core, plyometrics, and hip mobility work twice a week each.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm pretty athletic but I've never been good at team sports, so while all my friends were at soccer practice and naturally staying in shape I very much wasn't. Going in to quarantine I was pretty chubby, but I've since gotten super in to running, have lost a bunch of weight, and I'm making noticeable progress in terms of running and fitness.

If I could run every day I would (I usually do somewhere between 3 and 5 miles, 7:30 - 8 minutes a mile) because I really love it. The problem is that I get super sore calves and hamstrings. I think this is because I live in a rural, very hilly area, and there is a lot of elevation in my running course, but I'm not certain. Right now I do 2-3 days running one day rest, but even after a rest day I still tend to have some lingering soreness.

I start college in a couple days and am planning on working the running into my schedule to stay in shape. The problem is that I'm concerned the soreness is harming my performance, and I'm scared I'll fall off the wagon and lose the progress I've made. I have friends who say run closer to every other day, but I'm scared this will cost me the same aforementioned progress.

I really am very new to this and want your thoughts. Do I change the course I run so that it's less hilly? Do I take more rest time? Is there some certain vitamins or micro nutrients I should try getting more of?

### Race and Goal description
Blame /u/rickard0 for this one.  They complained about the lack of race reports so I made this one up.  This is something I did a few mos ago now.  Not a real race. 

I got bored at work and ended up watching some running videos on YouTube.  I came across [one from the Running Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQxTL5CCp7U) where they tried to run a “cheater’s 5k” as a challenge. Basically, the challenge is that you can stop your watch any time you want as much as you want and recover as long as you want.  So you run 5k but you may do it in 100M increments or even 50m increments if you so desire.  It’s up to you.  Some of the presenters on the channel ran the entire thing sprinting downhill for example, then walked back up the hill and did it again.  Yes, this is cheating but that’s entirely the point.  

For comparison of where I am fitness wise, my 5k PR is 32:39.  I ran that back in Oct of last year and have never been able to touch it since.  My mile PR is around 9:35ish but don’t ask me to string two of those back to back unless you have a burning desire to find out what I ate for lunch.  I can rack up a lot of miles (30+ every week this month including 45 last week) but I’m not fast.  My goal here was to see if I could break sub 30 by cheating and maybe even sub 25.

### Training
No training.  Who needs to train when you plan to cheat?  Do you train if you plan to hire a bib mule?  Do course cutters train?  Of course not.  Bang a trash can lid for me bros!

### Pre-race
I thought about heading to the park for this as they have a loop that’s exactly 5k. It also has the advantage of not being interrupted by street crossings, people backing out of their driveways, etc…. Then I realized that since I’m cheating it doesn’t matter.  

It’s been 95+ every day for the past week and a half but today, for whatever reason, it was gorgeous.  Sunny skies with a high of only 80F.  It was very, very, very windy (20-25 mph+) but I figured I could run with the wind at my back and it’d be fine.  Not quite perfect weather for running but as good as you’re going to get around here right now.

I found a segment of the path that seemed ideal.  It’s in a very small park with little foot traffic, and it gradually slopes down hill for about a quarter mile. I’d have to run this a dozen times and this would be similar to running a 5k on a track but we were after speed here, not scenery. It seemed to me that the key was to get running at full blast, then start the watch, not while accelerating.  Also, stop the watch before you slow down.  This way you eliminate the speed up/slow down periods. 

### Race

The segment in the park was about a mile or so from my house so I slow jogged there, took a breather to cool down and rest and started my attempt.  I had a place on the sidewalk I wanted as a starting line and a place on the sidewalk at the end as an ending line.  I got running full blast, hit the watch as I went past the line and kept going until I hit the other line and pushed the watch once I was past it.  Then I would walk or slow jog the quarter mile back, catch my breath, cool down and hit it again.  This lasted for about ¾ miles before I realized I am not a smart man.  By doing things this way I literally doubled the distance I had to cover.  I was not only running 5k, I was walking 5k as well.  Plus, it was taking me too long to walk the quarter mile.  It took me 40-50 mins just do the first ¾ mile so I changed plans.  The trail has a hill at either side and a flat section in between.  I started running down one hill and to the base of the other.  Then I’d stop, walk up the hill, catch my breath and run back the other way.  It sort of worked. I still ended up doing just as much walking as I did running but was more efficient at it.  Going down one hill meant running into the wind but I don’t think this slowed me down significantly.  I got weird looks from the homeless people in the park and it took 90+ mins but I got it done. 

### Post Race
When I finished my watch went off telling me that I had a brand new PR for 5k and for a mile.  Yay!  I looked at it and realized that these times are great for me but really not that great overall.  For reference, if I had run this 21:34 time in a local 5k I’d have finished 14th overall and wouldn’t even have won my age group. Even when cheating I’m a shitty runner.  I regularly see people post their 18 min 5ks here and I couldn’t even crack 20 mins by cheating like a mofo. 

I now have a new respect for sprinters.  Those shorter distances (I was really only running a few 100m at a time) are just as much a killer as the longer ones.  I also have new respect for people who legitimately run these times.  You guys are all rock stars and the effort that goes into those speeds is just insane.  I can’t imagine ever running these times.  For grins and giggles, I put my time into Jack Daniel’s VDOT calculator and it worked out to a 3:26 marathon.  Now I’m gonna tell everyone I could’ve broken 3:30 if there were races this spring.

I will say that as an outcome of this I changed my running form.  I found that when I was running these hills and even when I was running the flat parts at the bottom of the hill that I naturally pushed my hips forward and ran more upright with a lean.  I have incorporated this into my form over the past two mos since this challenge and I do think it's helped me avoid injuries if nothing else.

,running,"Hi everyone,

So after 14 years in track, 13 of which I have been hurdling I am considering a switch from sprint hurdling to 800m. Mainly due to a series of injuries and stagnating in the middle of nowhere performance-wise I think I’d like a challenge/change. I am 24 years old and at a point where I either go all in with 110mH or try something new. 

I am an average hurdler (110mH pr : 14.3, 100m: 10.9). I have also run the occasional 400m (sub 50 a few times) 400mH (sub- 54 with 13 strides to for 6 hurdles) when asked to sub in for club and college meets. However despite sprinting for most of my life, I am not a natural sprinter, I’ve been avoiding that fact. I am a 6ft, lean 143 lb (65 kg) Kenyan with an abnormally long stride. 

Based on the information here (I’m happy to give more on request) do you believe I have the potential to be a good middle distance runner, particularly in the 800m? I love the idea of aiming towards a sub-1:55 800m (or are least a better middle distancer than a hurdler), but I can’t tell if I’m being too optimistic. If yes, what kind of training should I be doing to make the transition as efficiently and effectively as possible? Just for context I am at grad school in Canada so will have access to a gym and track when that time comes.

,running,"Okay so for a little bit of context, it's been a lifelong dream of mine to join the military. I am currently 17-years-old and am about to start my senior year of high school. I plan on going into the Air Force shortly after. Now, I'm by no means an athlete. Before COVID, I weighed a little over 240 pounds but I have since dropped to 211.6 as of this morning.

The way I did this is by eating very little and using my elliptical machine. The problem is that I can ""run"" on an elliptical machine for 33 minutes straight (3 minute warm-up plus 30 minute run) and I usually go around 2.7 - 3.0 miles. Now, the last time I actually ran a mile was in PE nearly 3 years ago and it was somewhere around 12-13 minutes. To pass the Air Force PT test (get the lowest non-0 score), I need to run 1.5 miles in less than 13 minutes and 36 seconds.

Now, if I ran at a pace of 13 minutes per mile, that would put me at 19 minutes and 30 seconds which is well over the required amount.

So here's the question: is there a good way to know for sure that I can beat this 13:36 time based on my elliptical performance? I find it really weird that I can run much further on an elliptical than on foot and I figured that as I lose weight I will gradually get faster but I am still concerned because I don't have a track I can benchmark myself on (thanks to COVID I can't use a public one either) and I'm in a really bad position to be out of shape. Obviously I will keep doing what I can which consists of basically 33 minutes of elliptical exercise daily and restricting how much I eat. So basically, I want to know how much progress I should be making and how much my time is reasonably going to improve (I know that it's unrealistic to get an 8 minute mile in a week and it's also unrealistic to drop 30 seconds in an entire year so what's a realistic rate of improvement given the limited exercise I get?)

If anyone has any advice, please share it because mentally I'm the perfect candidate for the Air Force (I even scored really high on the ASVAB, which measures your aptitude and helps determine your entry / job) and the only thing holding me back is my physical ability.

Sorry for the long read!

TL;DR: I run slow, need to run fast, have access to elliptical machine.

PS. I forgot to mention, I absolutely hate running like I imagine everyone out of shape does and I have to force myself to do a half-hour elliptical session every day that is basically a warm up compared to some of the runners out there.

,running,"I feel weird coming here because I'll be honest, I HATE running.  I do it to lose weight and it's become a part of my life, so now 250lbs down from my peak I'm still 320lbs and shooting for a goal of 250 lbs. So as I picked up speed I started taking it more seriously.  Pre-quarantine I did it because walking wasn't doing enough and biking became too cold in the winters here (sub-40s and the wind sheer near the rivers/trails started to give me legitimate frostbite issues).  Now I've been running for almost a year and I am questioning my times and distance.  

Previously, I relied strictly on my phone.  My normal twice a day break run was about 1.1-1.2 miles depending on how it calculated it.  My lunch became a 5K daily.  I since bought a fitbit that now pegs my runs at around .8 miles and 2.2-2.5 miles respectively.  If I'm closer to my phone's times, my mile is around 8-9 minutes and my 5K is around 24-25, sometimes dipping down to the 23s because the majority of it is on a flat playground surface while the two shorter runs are up and down hills (small distances but significant for me).  If the Fitbit is correct, I'm running closer to 12 minute miles and not even coming into a 5k at all.  

I'm trying to gather if at 6'3"" 320lbs these numbers are wildly off, am I slow? am I fast? Is the Fitbit way off or the phone?  Both use GPS.  The Fitbit is a new Charge 4 with built-in GPS, the phone was a S9+ now a S20+.  The phone has differed significantly back and forth, dropping the runs from as little as .7 miles to upwards of 1.6 miles and the 5K down to 2.7 Miles and up to 3.6 miles but generally settles into a pretty steady pattern which is what I took for granted ultimately.

I generally base my eating/weight loss goals off the phone's steady measurements for calories and have come out reliably close to it (off by about 10-15% at times in both directions) and with running i've hit far more plateaus where I'll stay a weight for 20-40 days then drop 20 lbs in a matter of a week.  

I know this is a TON to take in and I'm sorry if it seems disorganized I'm just the only real runner I know and getting a sense of 'is this fast' and 'am I really running this far' short of breaking out surveyor equipment (which is quite honestly my next step...) I figure I would ask reddit for advice.

 

* Age: 36
* Sex: Male
* Current MPW + pace: As stated, Phone says 25-26, around 8m.  Fitbit closer to 20, around 10-12m
* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed: I'm normally running that distance and then biking between 30-50 miles a week, usually 10-25 mi in a go, 2-3x a week.
* Additional info: I wear size 40 waist pants, XL T-shirts, and i'm 6'3"" but have non-hereditary scoliosis so I'm actually closer to 6'4-5"" adjusted for that.  23.5"" shoulders as well.

I since bought a fitbit that now pegs my runs at around .8 miles and 2.2-2.5 miles respectively.  If I&amp;#39;m closer to my phone&amp;#39;s times, my mile is around 8-9 minutes and my 5K is around 24-25, sometimes dipping down to the 23s because the majority of it is on a flat playground surface while the two shorter runs are up and down hills (small distances but significant for me).  If the Fitbit is correct, I&amp;#39;m running closer to 12 minute miles and not even coming into a 5k at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to gather if at 6&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; 320lbs these numbers are wildly off, am I slow? am I fast? Is the Fitbit way off or the phone?  Both use GPS.  The Fitbit is a new Charge 4 with built-in GPS, the phone was a S9+ now a S20+.  The phone has differed significantly back and forth, dropping the runs from as little as .7 miles to upwards of 1.6 miles and the 5K down to 2.7 Miles and up to 3.6 miles but generally settles into a pretty steady pattern which is what I took for granted ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally base my eating/weight loss goals off the phone&amp;#39;s steady measurements for calories and have come out reliably close to it (off by about 10-15% at times in both directions) and with running i&amp;#39;ve hit far more plateaus where I&amp;#39;ll stay a weight for 20-40 days then drop 20 lbs in a matter of a week.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a TON to take in and I&amp;#39;m sorry if it seems disorganized I&amp;#39;m just the only real runner I know and getting a sense of &amp;#39;is this fast&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;am I really running this far&amp;#39; short of breaking out surveyor equipment (which is quite honestly my next step...) I figure I would ask reddit for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age: 36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sex: Male&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current MPW + pace: As stated, Phone says 25-26, around 8m.  Fitbit closer to 20, around 10-12m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed: I&amp;#39;m normally running that distance and then biking between 30-50 miles a week, usually 10-25 mi in a go, 2-3x a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional info: I wear size 40 waist pants, XL T-shirts, and i&amp;#39;m 6&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; but have non-hereditary scoliosis so I&amp;#39;m actually closer to 6&amp;#39;4-5&amp;quot; adjusted for that.  23.5&amp;quot; shoulders as well.  I&amp;#39;m a big frame, my plastic surgeon group i&amp;#39;m working with is advocating not dropping below 240 unless I&amp;#39;m going for some very lean/cut position and that will start cutting into muscle mass to chase that goal.&lt;/li&gt;

,running,"Had a very weird week with my running.

I've been building up my long runs for a few months now - I got up to 15 miles two weeks ago, though it took a lot of out me. Last week I did 14 as I could feel that I was struggling just as much as I was on the previous weeks 15 miler  - So stopped at 14 and walked the last mile home.

But this week my running has been odd. Usually run 4 times a week. My 'recovery run' was OK, but then my second run felt really bad - wanted to go about 7-8 miles but had to call it at 5.5, just couldn't get my breathing under control even though I was pacing myself at an even lower pace than I ran my 14 miler at. My last run yesterday was just appalling. I ran all of 2 miles - I was getting weird pains in my chest that moved to my core and across each side l, along with stitches and general weary legs - I felt utterly awful. May have been something as simple as trapped wind, though never had that problem before. But I had to call it. Again. 

I don't really understand what's happening here. 

On top of which, my shoes seem to have shrunk or warped slightly (possibly going through a few puddles, then drying up) and they've been pinching my toenails.

So, I've ordered a new pair of Brooks Ghost 12 GTX (first time trying Brooks out) but they will arrive Monday at the earliest. This means that for all the reasons mentioned above along with the shoes - I don't think I'm going to even attempt my long run on Sunday. 

Given that my week has already been tapered down, though forced, will it have any effect on my fitness/training? 

It's just that I've been consistent for so long that this feels really bad and I feel like for some reason I've lost all progress this week.

,running,"I'm a 41yo mum who runs for 'quiet time', five times a week (approx 50kms/wk), early in the morning before the kids wake up. I've been running as a hobby for many years but never trained for anything serious or participated in any races. Max distance prior to training was 16km. Average pace 5:40min/km.

GOAL set in May 2020: 
To achieve a sub 2hr Half Marathon.

TRAINING: 
Garmin 12 week training plan with Coach Greg. I was very dedicated &amp; didn't deviate from the program.

A few days before I had a confidence crisis and told my family that I wasn't going through with the race just yet and that I had extended the training program by a few weeks. But on the morning of the 15th, I woke up super early and the weather was the coolest it had been for weeks. I decided to go for it, in secret, so if I failed, nobody would know. This is why I called it the Secret Half Marathon!

PRE-RACE: 
I always run fasted so I popped a couple of gels in my pocket (just in case) and off I went. I didn't even have a specific course in mind. 

RACE: 
I just ran my usual training route with a few different turns and loops to mix it up. It was a fairly flat, very picturesque coastal route. 

WEATHER: 
overcast, 20 degrees C, low wind. Almost perfect! The humidity was very high. 

STATS from my Garmin forerunner 245:
Average pace 5:25min/km
Best pace 4:43min/km
Average heart rate 173bpm (I was pulling out all the stops!)
Average cadence 174

I won't bore you with splits! But they were very steady as I was looking at my watch regularly to avoid having to 'catch up' at the end. I felt like the final 5kms was harder than usual. I really had to push through mentally so that I didn't drop the ball. That's when I consumed the gel.

RESULT: 1:54:26. 

CELEBRATION: 
I crept into the house and woke up my family to tell them the great news. Although hubby isn't into running, he's very supportive of me. My 8yo son was very proud of me and came running around the block with me as a victory lap/cool down. This was the best bit!

Average pace 5:25min/km
Best pace 4:43min/km
Average heart rate 173bpm (I was pulling out all the stops!)
Average cadence 174&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t bore you with splits! But they were very steady as I was looking at my watch regularly to avoid having to &amp;#39;catch up&amp;#39; at the end. I felt like the final 5kms was harder than usual. I really had to push through mentally so that I didn&amp;#39;t drop the ball. That&amp;#39;s when I consumed the gel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RESULT: 1:54:26. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CELEBRATION: 
I crept into the house and woke up my family to tell them the great news. Although hubby isn&amp;#39;t into running, he&amp;#39;s very supportive of me. My 8yo son was very proud of me and came running around the block with me as a victory lap/cool down. This was the best bit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As satisfied as I&amp;#39;m feeling right now, I feel a bit lost as to what to do next! Suggestions for my next goal...?&lt;/p&gt;

,running,"Have been wondering about this since I had a rather unfortunate situation unfold last week. My wife and I both have been running for over a year. We both run 3 times a week somewhere between 7-10 miles per run. The only real difference is that my wife runs without doing things like intervals, hill running, etc. She just sticks to road running where I mix it up a little more. Recently I tried joining a local Run Club and was contacted by the person who organizes the runs. At first he seemed like a cool dude and let me know what days they run, how far, etc. and it seemed like we were good to go. Things turned for the worst when I mentioned that my wife would be coming along. Here is a recap of our conversation:

Him: Is she also a runner?

Me: Yes she's been running for the same amount of time as I have.

Him: What are her splits? Time difference between hill runs vs road runs? What about trail? Does she have specific shoes she uses? Why or why not? Average heart rate over the last 6-9 months? 

Me: She doesn't track those things. She just runs on the road and does, on average, 7 miles at about 11 minutes/mile. 

Him: My friend, that is not a runner. That is a jogger. A runner keeps track of all data to constantly improve. A jogger goes out for a stroll just because the weather is nice, they want to be perceived as fit and upper middle class, or they have a weight issue. You're more than welcome to come but I'm afraid she would have to find somewhere else to go. 

Me: But the route you guys go on is all road and you specifically stated that the group runs at about 13 minutes/mile pace. Sounds like she would be able to keep up just fine. Also, I don't appreciate you being so condescending and implying things based on whether someone runs or doesn't run to your standards. I also find it interesting you didn't care to ask me any of those same questions but for some reason you need to know everything about her routine. 

Him: Already made my decision, friend. You don't have to come if it bothers you so much but you'd be missing out on hanging out with like-minded people who strive for physical excellence. 

After that I basically said thanks but no thanks. Still, it made me hesitant about running with others. I really don't understand how she's not a real runner because she just runs and isn't tracking everything. This is the first time I've ever tried running with other people and will probably be the last.

,running,"I am posting this race info because I suspect it might be one of the only 5k 'fun runs' that actually happened this summer in Canada (maybe North America?). It was my first road race since COVID and I also thought everyone would be interested in how that went in terms of physical distancing, masks etc. 

**Race Info**

Date: ~~August 13, 2020~~ postponed due to thunderstorms, so August 20th, 2020, 6:30pm

Distance: 5KM

Location: Winnipeg, Manitoba

Time: 26:44

**Goals**

**A: Have fun, run under 30 mins -** achieved!

**B: Have fun, run under 25 mins -** if it hadn't been &gt;33 degrees, this might have been possible

**C: Have fun, finish -** achieved

**Training**

36F, life-long runner but haven't done a big race (read: marathon) since pre-kids, which means it's... ahem... been 10 years! Planning to do a marathon this fall, as with more time (thanks COVID) combined with older kids has allowed me to do more long runs. Currently running 30-35 miles per week, pace around 9:40 min miles. My 5k PR is 21:30 but that was like 20 years ago so I don't think it counts anymore? Marathon PR is 3:55.

**Recap**

This was a fun run, so no official timing but I used NRC app to time it. It was at an awkward time of day - 6:30pm - but that was because of the fun part - craft brew at the end!  Unfortunately, it was incredibly hot and humid this week and our car registered 33 degrees C when we arrived at the race. Ugh! We don't get a lot of humidity in Winnipeg but what little we get was in full force. Felt more like 35+ degrees. Add to that the mandatory mask wearing (I used a buff) at the starting line and it was very uncomfortable even before starting the run. 

In terms of COVID restrictions, the race organizers did a great job of following current health regulations. There are few cases in Winnipeg at the moment, so the risk is relatively low, but everyone wore masks at beginning and end, and the race was limited to 100 participants (looked like maybe even less to me, possibly because the original date was postponed due to thunderstorms). 

Each person was assigned a bib with a colour to indicate which 'wave' to start the race. There were 4 waves of max 25 runners with 10 minutes in between. This really worked to space things out - I didn't have to run near anyone else (other than my running partner spouse) for pretty much the whole race. 

There weren't any lineups for beer or poutine at the end either because the race was so staggered. But it still felt like a 'social' race (compared to say, a virtual race), so I think the balance was good. 

As for the run - not only was it hot, it was hilly! Winnipeg is SO flat but this route went up and down a dusty hot embankment at the side of a highway. Not pretty, but I tried to remember the cold beer waiting at the end! Did the first mile at an 8:30 pace but the hills and heat killed my second mile, which was 9:10. Last mile at 8:38 somewhat compensated as it was more downhill. Overall, it was painful but thankfully 5ks are short so the hurt was short-lived!

Lastly I want to give a shout out to the race organizers for some awesome swag: Not only did we get  a nice lime popsicle at the  finish line, followed by a pint of craft brew and a fresh made (vegetarian) poutine, we got a pair of Goodr sunglasses, a running hat, a honey stinger gel, and a giant, artisanal chocolate medal!

,running,"So with the way things are in the world right now, it's a bit of a confusing time for me as a runner. I was slated to run my first marathon (St. Louis) back in March and had been doing well with the training before it was pushed back to October and ultimately postponed. I had started my marathon training in June/July of 2019, ran my first half in October 2019, and had trained pretty much right up until the race was suspended.

Provided things improve, I am looking to register again for the 2021 race in St. Louis. Assuming I use a 12-16 week training plan, I wouldn't have to start seriously training again until December 2020, but I was hoping to build a decent foundation before then. I am still in decent running shape, having gone 511 miles so far in 2020 and averaging over 16 miles in the past four weeks without any race goal in mind, per Strava. I feel like I could still do a decent half at the drop of a hat and will probably run one on my own/virtually this fall just for fun.

Does anyone with a couple of marathons under their belt have any suggestions for a good base training load? I was thinking of setting a goal of at least 30 miles a week, so I would only have to increase at maximum 14/15 miles during training (the plan I was following maxed out at a 44 mile week). Any thoughts?

Recently picked up some new Brooks and have a Garmin on the way today, so I've got the new gear to help keep me motivated 😉",t2_7omx3fzn,False,,0,False,Marathoners: Good base training plan?,[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-question,0,,False,t3_ie0d08,False,dark,0.6,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598057280.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with the way things are in the world right now, it&amp;#39;s a bit of a confusing time for me as a runner. I was slated to run my first marathon (St. Louis) back in March and had been doing well with the training before it was pushed back to October and ultimately postponed. I had started my marathon training in June/July of 2019, ran my first half in October 2019, and had trained pretty much right up until the race was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided things improve, I am looking to register again for the 2021 race in St. Louis. Assuming I use a 12-16 week training plan, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to start seriously training again until December 2020, but I was hoping to build a decent foundation before then. I am still in decent running shape, having gone 511 miles so far in 2020 and averaging over 16 miles in the past four weeks without any race goal in mind, per Strava. I feel like I could still do a decent half at the drop of a hat and will probably run one on my own/virtually this fall just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone with a couple of marathons under their belt have any suggestions for a good base training load? I was thinking of setting a goal of at least 30 miles a week, so I would only have to increase at maximum 14/15 miles during training (the plan I was following maxed out at a 44 mile week). Any thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

The last few years have been really tough on me with certain health issues as well as tearing my right achilles 3 years ago playing basketball. I just started running this May and have really enjoyed it... just being back on my feet to primarily RUN was already a huge accomplishment for me because I never thought I would be able to really run properly again after tearing my achilles. I was planning on running my first Half this Sunday (23rd). I registered for it and everything.. but then on my run last Sunday (16th) at about 9km in I started getting sharp pains in BOTH of my achilles every step I took. I tried to keep going for a bit after that but I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't even walk the rest of the way back. I had to call my girlfriend to come pick me up... Prior to this I didn't have any issues running so far. No pains like this, not soreness, etc. I've been increasing mileage slowly each week.. stretching thoroughly, doing my strength work, etc etc. It kind of just came on out of nowhere..

I'm 30 yo and can run about a 10-11 minute mile right now. I use to wrestle in high school but was never a big runner. I'm 5'5 and weigh 155.

Do you guys have any tips for getting there? My wife thinks getting endurance first, then speed. So we plan to work my way up to running 3mi then focus on timing. Is this the play or should I just try and get speed down since its only 1 mile. Along with building endurance I think my biggest problem is breathing.

A bit more detail - Been running for a while - nothing too serious, but trying to stay healthy as I get older. I’ve been running a lot more since COVID-19 30-40 miles a week. I beat the crap out of my last shoes, because I wasnt used to putting so many miles in in such a short period of time. So, I just got a new pair and (a) they’re way, way more comfortable and (b) my back pain is gone. I obviously didn’t realize how worn my old shoes were, because pre-covid I wasn’t burning through shoes so quickly. 

So I’ve seen people suggesting getting two pairs of shoes and alternating between them to prolong their life. Now that I run a bit more, and especially because I’m running most days I’m considering this. 

I’d like to get a different pair of shoes because I don’t know that much about shoes and I’d like to try to find what works best for me. But I really don’t want to hurt myself if wearing a different shoe every other day is going to screw me up somehow.

So, I just got a new pair and (a) they’re way, way more comfortable and (b) my back pain is gone. I obviously didn’t realize how worn my old shoes were, because pre-covid I wasn’t burning through shoes so quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve seen people suggesting getting two pairs of shoes and alternating between them to prolong their life. Now that I run a bit more, and especially because I’m running most days I’m considering this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to get a different pair of shoes because I don’t know that much about shoes and I’d like to try to find what works best for me. But I really don’t want to hurt myself if wearing a different shoe every other day is going to screw me up somehow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought?&lt;/p&gt;

###For you new runners, please check out the info that is in the Wiki.

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq#wiki_for_beginners) the section in the Wiki for beginners (which can also apply to returning runners).  [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/index/common_questions#wiki_i.2019ve_never_run_before.2C_what_do_i_do.3F) also has some good tips.

[This resource](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3TYR3d9S1s1dFpwa3E4NmZfOW8/view) is linked in the sidebar/top menu and may have some info you can use as you get started (or back into) running.

Take some time to the search the sub and browse the daily Official Q&amp;A thread and you will find plenty of tips for getting started/back.
____


###**Using r/running**

The mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*

The mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.*

Regardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.*

_____

###**Rules**

**(1)** - *Follow proper Reddiquette [Keep it civil!] and the subreddit's Posting Procedures [post flair, using Daily/Weekly Threads].  The moderation team reserves the right to remove content or restrict user posting privileges as necessary.*

We are all here to learn and discuss running.  And with the wide variety of run types, training plans, methods, etc., there will be varying opinions.   There is plenty of room here for disagreement and discussion.  There is no room for doing that in an uncivil manner.  Posters are expected to behave in a considerate manner knowing that they are interacting with people they do not know.  [Remember the human](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/human_reddiquette#wiki_please__do). With the anonymity of the internet, it is easy to say things you would never say to someone in person.  In addition, this medium does not allow tone to come through.  Please keep both of those facts in mind.

Behaviors that will not be tolerated:

* Threats

* Excessive foul language

* Harassment

* Trolling

* Personal attacks

* Excessive aggression

* Use of any kind of slur

* Inappropriate/sexual comments

* Excessive back-and-forth arguing not related to the initial thread/comment

That being said, not every abrasive/abrupt comment is a personal or targeted attack.  In most cases, posters will be warned, and the offending comment/post removed.  Repeated violations will result in a ban.


 **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  

This sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&amp;A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&amp;A thread.

If you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:

* Age

* Sex

* Current MPW + pace

* Previous peak MPW

* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed

* Goals (including specific races)

* Previous PRs

* Other things you think might be helpful to include

Below are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&amp;A thread:

* If your post is just a question in the title.

* If your post is a question in the title plus “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body.

* If your question can be asked in one sentence.

* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.

* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.

* In general, it I helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  

* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.

Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.



**(3)** -  *No self-promotion (including links to personal blogs, social media, Youtube channel, etc.), advertising, spam, or surveys. This includes giveaways, charity events, and promotional discounts.*  

Self-promotion/advertising on /r/running is not allowed.  This sub is not the place to drive traffic to your blog, Youtube channel, social media, business, whatever.  You can buy an ad from Reddit for this.  Posts and comments such as these will be removed.  Repeated offenses will result in a ban.  If your username is the name of your product/business/service, you will automatically be banned.  Check out reddit's [self-promotion guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) for more info.

In addition, surveys of any sort are not allowed.  Runnit is not a free sample population to be used.


 **(4)** - *Please do not post elite race results in the title of posts. This includes the announcing of world records in titles.*

 **(5)** - *Please make your title descriptive. This means letting readers know roughly what your post will be about before they click. “Question” is not a good title for a post. Neither is “Help needed”. Do not use excessive emoji characters in the titles of posts.*

 **(6)** - *Displaying detailed personal information of anyone other than yourself is prohibited. Submission of content focused on ousting cheaters will be removed at the moderation team's discretion.*

 **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  

While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  

There is a big difference between ""Hey, my IT band is tight.  Got any good stretches for it?""  and ""My shins hurt every time I run.  If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?""  If your question involves sharp pains or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.

Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.


 **(8)** - *Submissions must be running-related.  Do not submit photos, videos, or memes that add nothing to the discussion.*  

Running related pictures and videos are allowed, but cannot be self-promotion [Rule 3] and must have some type of intro in the text body or comments as to why Runnit should click the link [Rule 10].

 **(9)** - *The 'TMI Rule' - Individual posts highlighting bodily functions such as bowel movements will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team.*

We don't need to hear about you crapping yourself or coming home with one sock. No, it doesn't make you a ""real"" runner.

**(10)** - *When posting articles, please include some text to start a discussion about the article.*  

/r/running does not allow threads that are solely sharing a link without any engagement.  If you are going to share something, at least provide a conversation starter.   Reposts of the same news topic, even from a different source, will most likely be removed unless it offers different details.

[Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/cescf3/should_i_finish_a_race_with_a_sprint_runnersworld/) of a good lead in statement for an article thread.

###**Daily and Weekly Threads**

In order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead. Here are the current daily and weekly threads:

Finally, there is a lot of info in the Wiki.  Yes, some of it is from old posts.  Yes, the layout is not the greatest.  It is always a work in progress.  

If you come across info that needs to be updated (or broken links), let us know.  If you see a post that should be in there, let us know.  If you see a lack of a helpful topic, let us know.

###**Thank you all for being a part of this community!**",t2_jjl35,False,,0,False,Reminder on Rules and Existing Daily/Weekly Threads,[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-psa,0,,False,t3_hi0ccp,False,dark,0.94,,public,64,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},PSA,False,64,,False,,1598831742.0,,[],{},,True,,1593467986.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After our usual surge around New Years, we’ve had a new surge of incoming users with all the Covid-19 self-isolation/self-quarantine/gym closures.  I wanted to repost a reminder about rules and also have it visible for new visitors to the community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since we are limited on how many posts can be stickied, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/g8dxq9/coronaviruscovid19_megathread_for_discussing/""&gt;here’s the link&lt;/a&gt; for the previously stickied Covid-19/Corona virus megathread.  Inside of that thread, there are many linked threads related to Covid-19/Corona virus changes to races, running while social distancing, virtual races, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, as a note, the mod team understands that it is almost impossible to get a doctor’s visit for anything non-emergency right now.  That doesn’t mean this is the place to find those answers instead.  People on the internet cannot diagnose or offer treatments.  If you have a question about pain/injury that is sharp, persistent, and/or unknown, that post will be removed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additionally, here&amp;#39;s the link for usual &lt;a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/running/comments/h9kyhs/its_that_awesome_time_of_year_for_the_summer_heat/""&gt;Heat, Humidity, Summer running thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;For you new runners, please check out the info that is in the Wiki.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq#wiki_for_beginners""&gt;Here&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; the section in the Wiki for beginners (which can also apply to returning runners).  &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/index/common_questions#wiki_i.2019ve_never_run_before.2C_what_do_i_do.3F""&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; also has some good tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3TYR3d9S1s1dFpwa3E4NmZfOW8/view""&gt;This resource&lt;/a&gt; is linked in the sidebar/top menu and may have some info you can use as you get started (or back into) running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some time to the search the sub and browse the daily Official Q&amp;amp;A thread and you will find plenty of tips for getting started/back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using &lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;r/running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of &lt;strong&gt;Rule 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Rule 7&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn’t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make &lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;/r/running&lt;/a&gt; a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in &lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;/r/running&lt;/a&gt; are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner….and also know when it is time to drop it.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Follow proper Reddiquette [Keep it civil!] and the subreddit&amp;#39;s Posting Procedures [post flair, using Daily/Weekly Threads].  The moderation team reserves the right to remove content or restrict user posting privileges as necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all here to learn and discuss running.  And with the wide variety of run types, training plans, methods, etc., there will be varying opinions.   There is plenty of room here for disagreement and discussion.  There is no room for doing that in an uncivil manner.  Posters are expected to behave in a considerate manner knowing that they are interacting with people they do not know.  &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/wiki/human_reddiquette#wiki_please__do""&gt;Remember the human&lt;/a&gt;. With the anonymity of the internet, it is easy to say things you would never say to someone in person.  In addition, this medium does not allow tone to come through.  Please keep both of those facts in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behaviors that will not be tolerated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Threats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive foul language&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harassment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trolling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal attacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive aggression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of any kind of slur&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate/sexual comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive back-and-forth arguing not related to the initial thread/comment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, not every abrasive/abrupt comment is a personal or targeted attack.  In most cases, posters will be warned, and the offending comment/post removed.  Repeated violations will result in a ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching &lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;r/running&lt;/a&gt;, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team&amp;#39;s discretion.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as “drive-by” posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&amp;amp;A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won&amp;#39;t get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&amp;amp;A thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current MPW + pace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous peak MPW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals (including specific races)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous PRs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other things you think might be helpful to include&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&amp;amp;A thread:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your post is just a question in the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your post is a question in the title plus “See title” or “Title says it all” in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your question can be asked in one sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your question is very specific to you or your situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it I helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of &lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;r/running&lt;/a&gt;, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3)&lt;/strong&gt; -  &lt;em&gt;No self-promotion (including links to personal blogs, social media, Youtube channel, etc.), advertising, spam, or surveys. This includes giveaways, charity events, and promotional discounts.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-promotion/advertising on &lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;/r/running&lt;/a&gt; is not allowed.  This sub is not the place to drive traffic to your blog, Youtube channel, social media, business, whatever.  You can buy an ad from Reddit for this.  Posts and comments such as these will be removed.  Repeated offenses will result in a ban.  If your username is the name of your product/business/service, you will automatically be banned.  Check out reddit&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion""&gt;self-promotion guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, surveys of any sort are not allowed.  Runnit is not a free sample population to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Please do not post elite race results in the title of posts. This includes the announcing of world records in titles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(5)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Please make your title descriptive. This means letting readers know roughly what your post will be about before they click. “Question” is not a good title for a post. Neither is “Help needed”. Do not use excessive emoji characters in the titles of posts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(6)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Displaying detailed personal information of anyone other than yourself is prohibited. Submission of content focused on ousting cheaters will be removed at the moderation team&amp;#39;s discretion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(7)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Do not solicit medical advice. This includes &amp;#39;Has anyone else experienced this injury?&amp;#39; type posts.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between &amp;quot;Hey, my IT band is tight.  Got any good stretches for it?&amp;quot;  and &amp;quot;My shins hurt every time I run.  If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?&amp;quot;  If your question involves sharp pains or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(8)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Submissions must be running-related.  Do not submit photos, videos, or memes that add nothing to the discussion.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running related pictures and videos are allowed, but cannot be self-promotion [Rule 3] and must have some type of intro in the text body or comments as to why Runnit should click the link [Rule 10].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(9)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The &amp;#39;TMI Rule&amp;#39; - Individual posts highlighting bodily functions such as bowel movements will be removed at the discretion of the moderation team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need to hear about you crapping yourself or coming home with one sock. No, it doesn&amp;#39;t make you a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(10)&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;When posting articles, please include some text to start a discussion about the article.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/running""&gt;/r/running&lt;/a&gt; does not allow threads that are solely sharing a link without any engagement.  If you are going to share something, at least provide a conversation starter.   Reposts of the same news topic, even from a different source, will most likely be removed unless it offers different details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/cescf3/should_i_finish_a_race_with_a_sprint_runnersworld/""&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt; of a good lead in statement for an article thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily and Weekly Threads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead. Here are the current daily and weekly threads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;amp;t=all""&gt;Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)&lt;/a&gt;: Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here.

In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don&amp;#39;t necessarily provoke useful discussion, in the daily General Q&amp;amp;A thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search/?q=%22weekly%20training%20thread%22&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1""&gt;Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)&lt;/a&gt;: This is where you will find posts on the training of your fellow runnitors for the week. Take a look at the various formats that are posted and feel free to post your own. It is also a great place to see what kind of training some of the more experienced runnitors are doing (though as mentioned, all are welcome to post). Please note that this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an accomplishment thread.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search/?q=Li%27l%20Race%20Reports&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;amp;sort=new""&gt;Li&amp;#39;l Race Reports Thread (Mondays)&lt;/a&gt;: This is a more recent addition to our recurring threads. It&amp;#39;s for anyone and everyone to use who&amp;#39;d like to write up a short summary about a race or recent run they did.

Any and all questions are welcome here with no judgment.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a lot of info in the Wiki.  Yes, some of it is from old posts.  Yes, the layout is not the greatest.  It is always a work in progress.  &lt;/p&gt;

He had no phone or ID on him, they had no idea who he was (though he's very proud that they estimated his age at 12 years below his actual age) or who to contact. He wasn't able to talk to tell them.

Thankfully he was found quickly by kind and helpful strangers and was treated quickly and effectively for his condition. Just a few short days later and he's independently mobile, eating and drinking as normal, can talk, read, and write, etc with just low level effects evident. The best possible outcome from a horrifying situation. There's little doubt his fitness level contributed significantly to his fantastic recovery to date.

Here's the Clif's Notes version:

Booneville Backroads Ultra - 100 Mile (Covid) Edition  (http://boonevillebackroadsultra.com/)
102.5 miles - 28hrs 10min  5th male, only 9 finished, out of 24 starters (7 men, 2 women).

Weather started out cool, but the temps hit the low 90's by afternoon and stayed there until about 6:00 PM with no clouds and little wind.  Stayed in the upper 70's through the finish.

I hit a few low points; most notably at ~50 miles and ~80 miles, but managed to work through it. I became intimately in tune with the complete mental screw game a race of this distance turns into later in the game.  I had an idea of what it would be like from training, but the magnitude of it was intense.

All said though, I felt pretty positive the whole time.  In fact, on the first and second 50k loops I was singing along with my music, and on the last leg I was telling delirium fueled dad jokes to my pacers (much to their amusement).

I am friends/acquaintances with a few of the runners, whom are much better runners than me, that DNF'd, and I am in shock that I managed to finish where a few of them didn't.  That sounds like I'm casting shade at them, but I think my relatively slower pace at the start saved me versus some of their faster starts once the heat turned up.

Lastly, by the last 20ish miles walking and running hurt about the same, so I tried to run as much as possible at the end.  It went better than I expected.

The last aid station had Mountain Dew pancakes, which were freaking amazing.  Mana from the running gods.  

Anyway, I had a blast!  I worked my ass off to get to this point in my running life.  I had a ton of support from my family and friends.  I can't begin to express the level of gratitude I have for them helping and even encouraging my insanity.  

I know 100 milers aren't for everyone, but if you can manage the highs and lows of training and running it, it is worth it.

,running,"Random observation and personal zen moment I thought I'd take the time to put into words.  

So I've been running for a little over 4 years now starting as with most people, the Couch to 5K.   In that time I've run 5000+ miles since that first 0.89 'run' in 2016 and burned a little over a million calories (random personal trivia).   

Training miles, slogging miles out regardless of heat, cold, wind, rain and snow, I don't enjoy them, I don't get a runner's high, I don't feel great running at the start, middle or end, most runs are painful in some way.  To say I'm not built for running is an understatement of biblical proportions. 

I take some small satisfaction in the sense of accomplishment but no enjoyment in the struggle to get better, to go longer. 

But...

For obvious reasons I haven't run a race in 7 months.   But yesterday on U.S. Labor Day we had a small trail race locally, in person.  A 5 mile and a 2 mile combined on a local trail system that has a wide range of surfaces and verticality. 

And that long gap of no racing really dialed in 'why' I run.  As i was sitting on top of my SUV keeping an eye out for a parking spot for my running partner I had a sense of elation and anticipation I haven't felt in... 7 months.  Watching runners show up, men, women, children, obvious elites and obvious people for whom this might very well be the start of their couch to 5k program.   And I realized this is why I run.  The gathering of like minded individuals, 'my tribe' if you will.  

For the record, I'm not fast, I rarely place in my age group mostly because there's a bunch of ringers in my age group or so I tell myself.  So 'winning' a race has no meaning for me which takes a lot of the pressure off I think.  No, a race for me at best is a race with the people immediately ahead of me but mostly with myself. 

When we lined up (in waves based on estimated pacing, properly distanced from each other) we all had the same goal, to finish that course in as short a time as possible for each of us.   Whatever that time ended up being.  For the curious a 12 year old took first overall with an average pacing of just over 6 minutes for 5 miles over some pretty technical sections.   The kid is... talented. 

And over the next 50 something minutes for me, every step, including one fall, was so much fun, so much sheer enjoyment, unlike the 1000's of miles I've put in to train, that it was a giant light bulb going off.  

The race is why I do it, especially trail races but road races too.  The race is why I throw good money away to get a cheap t-shirt that gets thrown in a box and cheaper mass produced participation medal to run courses that for the part I could run any time for free.   The race is what I look forward to in this sport/activity/personal masochism we call running. 

I know everyone who runs, runs for all the reasons, someones multiple reasons at once, fitness, stress relief, to eat all the things, socially, competitively, to get out of the house, the list is literally endless. 

But this apparently is mine.  :)",t2_24r9nwk5,False,,0,False,First in person race on Labor Day since covid reminded me why I do this...,[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-safety,0,,False,t3_ip692a,False,dark,0.88,,public,19,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,19,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599642338.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random observation and personal zen moment I thought I&amp;#39;d take the time to put into words.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been running for a little over 4 years now starting as with most people, the Couch to 5K.   In that time I&amp;#39;ve run 5000+ miles since that first 0.89 &amp;#39;run&amp;#39; in 2016 and burned a little over a million calories (random personal trivia).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training miles, slogging miles out regardless of heat, cold, wind, rain and snow, I don&amp;#39;t enjoy them, I don&amp;#39;t get a runner&amp;#39;s high, I don&amp;#39;t feel great running at the start, middle or end, most runs are painful in some way.  To say I&amp;#39;m not built for running is an understatement of biblical proportions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take some small satisfaction in the sense of accomplishment but no enjoyment in the struggle to get better, to go longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons I haven&amp;#39;t run a race in 7 months.   But yesterday on U.S. Labor Day we had a small trail race locally, in person.  A 5 mile and a 2 mile combined on a local trail system that has a wide range of surfaces and verticality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that long gap of no racing really dialed in &amp;#39;why&amp;#39; I run.  As i was sitting on top of my SUV keeping an eye out for a parking spot for my running partner I had a sense of elation and anticipation I haven&amp;#39;t felt in... 7 months.  Watching runners show up, men, women, children, obvious elites and obvious people for whom this might very well be the start of their couch to 5k program.   And I realized this is why I run.  The gathering of like minded individuals, &amp;#39;my tribe&amp;#39; if you will.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I&amp;#39;m not fast, I rarely place in my age group mostly because there&amp;#39;s a bunch of ringers in my age group or so I tell myself.  So &amp;#39;winning&amp;#39; a race has no meaning for me which takes a lot of the pressure off I think.  No, a race for me at best is a race with the people immediately ahead of me but mostly with myself. &lt;/p&gt;

,running,"...and for as small as it was, about 12-13 of us total, it was a success!

First off, mods, I apologize if this is against rules.  If it is, then I respectfully submit myself to do as you must.

Secondly, story time!   Prior to quarantine, a bunch of my cousins and some of our friends had been getting more into fitness, specifically running.  They were all looking forward to doing events that were coming up this year, but we all know what happened here.  Anyways,  when virtual race events became a thing a few months back, they looked to me (as out of our group, I had a bit more experience with running and running events) to set something up.  We ended up finding one of IRun4Movement's themes that we all thought was a fun theme and went with it.  We picked Labor Day weekend as it was a 3-day weekend and at that point, it was enough time for people to train for a 10k.  

Where most of the group lived was a flat area and most of their running was done just around their neighborhoods and local parks, so I picked a route that was a bit more scenic and had a bit more action, the Johnny Cash Trail.  This was a route my girlfriend and I had run before.  I thought it was perfect as it was a 10k that starts and ends at the same spot, there was a good change of pace as far as terrain, and it was a route with nice views that the group would not have seen otherwise.  

I set up a meeting spot and made a map of the parking location in relation to where the run would begin.  I mocked up a map of the run and did my best to describe the route as best as I could.  I set up a time for us to meet and what time we would be starting at.  I tried to give the best tips I know of what to expect on the run, how to prepare for the run, what to bring on the run, the etiquette of running on the trail, how to prepare for the hot weather (I picked an early start time because of this) etc.  I wanted to give them as much information as I could so we could all have a successful run.  For the most part, they were all running this for completion, not time, but for the ones that wanted to do it for time, I made sure to remind them to become familiar with the route.  

When yesterday came around and we were all at the meeting spot, I made sure to give reminders on all the route and all the things I pointed out.  When we started the race, I purposefully pulled ahead so I could get to parts of the route where people might get confused on where to turn.  It's a pretty straight forward route, but there are parts where you could make a wrong turn.  For the ones that fell too far behind, I sent them pictures of the checkpoints with an arrow or my hand pointing which way to go.  I had packed my hydration vest with 50/50 water gatorade mix in case anyone needed it, but luckily most everyone came prepared.  At each checkpoint, I pointed where they would go with some loud cheering to egg them on.  At the finish, my cousin's wife was there to cheer the finishers and to present them the medals.  

I know it was only a 10k, but to some of them, this was a big accomplishment.  This was the longest run they've had.  I wanted this to somewhat resemble a race day for those that haven't experience a race day yet.  In the end, everyone finished and everyone had a lot of fun doing it.  If I was to do it again, I want to come to the trail the day before and set up markers to help make it easier for those who pulled ahead to know where they're going.

* **What?** Ramboll Stockholm Halvmarathon Virtual Edition
* **When?** September 5, 2020
* **How far?** 13,1 miles
* **Finish time** 2:40


### Background
I (50M, 94kg, 178cm), decided to run the race about 10 months ago, a few months after I took up running.

Earlier in my life there has been close to none exercise in any form. Been more into cooking, baking and champagne.

The first months of training was tough for my body. Aching and I overtrained and hurt my knee, resulting in one month recovery wo running. 
Still I'm lucky to always long for my next run. Maybe because I can do something new and challenging I never thought was possible.
Also my suprised children, used to their foodie-dad, helped my motivation a lot.

I followed Hal Higdon's Half Marathon Novice 2 program. Did a lot of the training at my country house in the summer where it was hot, humid and hilly. Soon the longer distances felt fine.

I think the program was a little too short, next time I will do more long runs, as I really feel they improve me as a runner. Perhaps Matt Fitzgerald's, also with more speedwork.

My son was supposed to join me, but things got in his way, so my son in law took his place, with short notice (in the morning of the race day, talking about time to prepare...). He's quite athletic but never done so much running.

The night before the race my mother told me that my brother only have a couple of months left to live. In many ways I think that running is emotional and this would of course affect the race.

### Goals
| Goal | Description | Completed? |
|------|-------------|------------|
| A |&lt; 2.30 | *No* |
| B |&lt; 2.45 | *Yes* |
| C |Finish | *Yes* |

### Pre-race
Did nothing special, tried to drink extra the day before but my stomach didn't like that. So only a couple of toasts and a coffe in the morning.

### Race
The race was virtual so we ran close to where I live, in the centre of Stockholm. A very flat trail by the water.

I don't like to eat anything during my runs, so I drank powerade instead.

First 12k was fine and my plan was to have a negative split. However when the time came to speed up I noticed that that was not going to happen. Instead I would be glad to maintain my current pace.

My son in law started to get pain in his legs, but all my bodyparts was cooperating very well. Stamina-wise it was the opposite. The last 4 km was very painful, lost the tempo completely, never felt so exhausted and dizzy before.

### Post-race
Friends and my children was waiting at the finish line and I was very happy but completely bonked.

Afterwards we had a big dinner with a lot of discussions and wine.

I'm a little bit worried that I dragged my son in law into this. Will feel guilty if he gets any injuries.


### What's next?
Next I will start a 5k program to get faster and my plan is to do a HM-training plan with more volume. I think there is a lot of room for improvement.

Edit: Some people have been mentioning drinking water all day. Which I do! I drink at least 3-6L during the day, it helps me with my food pacing and I just generally like water. I don’t normally chug right before I run, but I’ll probably try spacing the drink and start of the run and see if that helps :)

&lt;p&gt;But lately it’s like no matter how much water I drink beforehand, I feel super dehydrated during my runs, even short ones (I’m trying to do a timed mile). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something here? I’ve been running for a couple years but it’s never been this bad... should I be drinking more water? Or would electrolytes help? Really looking for suggestions, anything helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Some people have been mentioning drinking water all day. Which I do! I drink at least 3-6L during the day, it helps me with my food pacing and I just generally like water. I don’t normally chug right before I run, but I’ll probably try spacing the drink and start of the run and see if that helps :) &lt;/p&gt;

I've been running for 14 years since I was a freshman in high school. Any seasoned runner will know how much will have changed by now, but on top of all the physical changes I also recovered from a fractured ankle four years ago.

I have a plate and seven screws on my ankle bone but by now I can still run as vigorously as I used to. I'd just like to get some insight on what to look for when buying new shoes. I have a pair of ASICS Men's GEL Venture 5 that I may be putting out of commission for something better - both ankles have been feeling somewhat sore from running on them this past year.

What should I look for when buying the best next pair of shoes? I recently came across a shoe fitting guide that recommended I bought shoes for Stability (mid-height), but I'm also thinking I may need to look for good ankle support... Or maybe not?

**Distance: 42,2km**

**Time: 03:54:33**

**Backstory:** Stockholm Marathon was cancelled this year and they compensated runners with moving the ticket to 2021 and getting the Stockholm Virtual Run for free, so if you run a marathon between 4.9-6.9.2020 you get a t-shirt and medal. The idea of just running a marathon in Helsinki seemed a bit lack lustering so I decided to spice it up by doing 105,5 laps on the local track field. I always found track and treadmill running a bit boring since the scenery is the same, so I knew this was going to be a real challenge.

**Training:** Jogger from Finland with 1,5 years of running experience. Two weeks prior to this I ran a personal best on Helsinki Marathon (03:37:31), and I’ve been hitting a record high mileage for the past couple of weeks. I was not ready for another marathon.

**Location:** Eläintarha Athletic Field, Helsinki, Finland

**Weather:** Temperature was somewhat cool at 15-20C and 88% humidity. Only rained a little bit in the beginning of the run.

**Nutrition:** Water, sport drink, protein bar, energy gels

**Measuring distance:** I had my Garmin Fenix 5 to lap at 400m and if my clock seemed off I would correct this by running the next lap more on the inner/outer track, depending on if I was lacking some meters, or if I had too much. This was to ensure that I would run 105,5 laps

**Splits:** I started off by running the first 12 laps alone without any issues, then one of my friends joined me for about 25 laps and the laps passed without any issues. After this I ran about 15 laps alone and then another friend joined me for 10 laps. I hit the halfway point relatively easy and soon after the 70-lap mark followed. However, at this point it all started to go downhill. I started to lose the mental battle. I was completely alone and literally running in circles. I tried to focus on one lap at the time. At every lap after this one I would think “only xx laps left”. Willpower was the only thing keeping me going. I struggled for a long time and finally made it to the last 10 laps. At this point my body and mind were completely done and my pace dropped by a lot. After my final 0,5 lap I fell and just lied on the field, grateful that it was over.

**Postrace:** It was nice to challenge myself and to able to say that I’ve done it, but doubt I’ll do it again. In the end my neck and left leg were hurting from only turning and looking left. I can't imagine doing this without friends.

So as to not offend any sensibilities, I've kept the title deliberately vague.

I'm aware of the usual mantra that if your illness is 'in the head' (i.e. cold) then you're fine the run, if it's in the chest (cough) you shouldn't be running.

I'm making adjustments to my diet to see if that will help but without getting too graphic, I'm going to toilet several times a day and while it's not full diarrhoea, it's generally loose stools.

I was able to go for a walk (3.5mi) yesterday with no issues and while I went to toilet when I got home, at no point was I struggling mid way through.

,running,"Hi all, I've found a new love for running. I'm successfully using it after quiting drugs to focus my mind, give me some 'me' time, let some rage out and get healthier. 

I've been running regularly for a around two months, 3 times a week and just completing the Couch to 5K app program. I felt this was the best way as I was 315lb when I started working on my nutrition back in February, and now with combined effort from running I'm at 260lb. 

Now I've got myself into the rhythm of running regularly, come rain or shine (I live in Scotland!) I'm looking at making sure I'm using the right shoes to avoid injury. 

I'm a big lad, I've been told at least I'll have high bone density, but ballistic impact from running is a lot to take on my ankles, shins and knees and I am starting to feel regardless of how much I warm up and stretch they are all starting to groan a little which is really demotivating while in the middle of a run.

I currently run on tarmac, and will be for the foreseeable. I'm wearing good fitting Nike Metcon 5' but they are very much a all-round gym/cross fit shoe and do very little to stop impact travel (as my foot goes down I can feel the vibrations traveling up my front shin). 

I am booked into a local store next week to get my gait recorded and my foot structure analysed to see what the best type of shoe will be for me. I was wondering if there were any other things I could do to make sure I avoid I just other than having more than a days rest between runs (I really need to run to help with sobriety)

,running,"Hey. If you are feeling discouraged or not willing to put on your shoes to go outside often any more, some things I have found that helped me a lot:

1) I always listen to an audiobook while running. This is the main thing that keeps me running for sure. Without it, I would get so bored listening to the rhythm of my feet hitting the ground or whatever.

Time passes so fast on a run when I'm engrossed in a book. While listening, suddenly 5km flies by. Most like listening to music on a run, and I do too, but that does not get me excited to make the effort to decide to run, because I listen to music all day at home or at work. 

If you don't want to listen to an audiobook, go for music or perhaps an app you can learn a language with. I would not enjoy running at all if I could not listen to something. Just stay safe with regards to cars and the road of course.

2) Download an app on your phone like Strava that tracks your runs. It's quite a fun game to see how you progress, and partly get you ashamed of a lull in activity by you if you see your friends constantly posting, lol. (My brother has run like 10km every day for 3 years, you're crazy...)

3) But seriously, do not worry about how fast people around you run, or how often. Just focus on yourself. You don't even have to aim to get better, just aim to keep healthy.

4) If you're feeling hurt or out of breath, just walk or stop (ideally at somewhere pretty!). There is no shame in it at all. Don't hurt yourself and make yourself dread running because you know it hurts.

In the same vein, take rest days constantly. I was running every day for a while early on and hurt my knee because of it. I highly recommend at least 1 rest day in between runs.

5) Everyone knows to buy good running shoes, but also get good running socks. I got some Injinji toesocks, where it's individual fabric for each toe. Annoying to put on (legit takes over 2 minutes lol), but stopped me getting blisters that would discourage me from running more. 

Hopefully this helps.

I’m a runner and personal trainer, and with gyms opening back up I wanted to share a workout routine for anyone who was interested. 

This workout is great for sprinters and fast mid distance runners, but could help anyone gain some lower body strength. 

Superset (3 sets)
Deadlift: Heavy weight, 3-6 reps
Power Clean: Mid weight, 6-10 reps

Superset (3 sets)
Pause Squat: Mid weight, 8-12 reps
Split Squat: Mid weight, 8-12 reps each leg

Superset (3 sets)
Box Jumps, 10-12 reps
Single Leg Box Jumps*, 6-10 reps each leg
Single Leg Squats*, 6-10 reps each leg

*Only do the single leg exercises if you feel comfortable doing so. If you are new to strength training you’ll want to work up to doing these. 

These exercises will help build strength, especially in the posterior chain, which helps your initial push out of the gate. It also works on explosive power and stamina, which help give an extra kick for sprints. 

Make sure you warm up and cool down properly! Let me know if you have any questions. Also let me know if any of you find this helpful, and I’ll make another post for a core workout and maybe a distance running focused workout.",t2_3c17doj,False,,0,False,Strength workout,[],r/running,False,6,linkflair-training,0,,False,t3_ioltrg,False,dark,0.87,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Training,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599562577.0,text,6,,,text,self.running,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!

So I am a 29 year old male. I started running in early 2017. I run pretty consistently. I run about 3-4 times a week at about 3-4 miles per run. 

Since the pandemic started in March, I have been in a funk. I have not been as motivated to run as I used to be. I may run only once a week now. 

A few months ago I injured my Achilles tendonitis and had to wait for that to heal. Also my feet have been bothering me. On top of that, I may have a case of runners knee. 

Internally I believe I suffer from IBS. It has affected my runs but usually it’s not too bad. The last few months when I run, I get horrible cramps on the last mile of my run. I literally have to slow way down to make it bearable. I’m thinking it maybe nutrition related or the fact that I live in Georgia where it is hot all the time. I may not drink enough water either. 

I used to run a 5K in 22-23 minutes but lately I have been running them in 28 minutes which is horrendously slow and embarrassing. This gets me even more down than I am already am and causes me to not want to run.

### Training
Male, 29 years old. 

Over the last 8 years I've been a casual runner, emphasis on the casual, not more than 3 a week and stopping for months or years at a time. 1 marathon and two 1/2 marathons.  After reaching peak weight in February (work trip to US did not help) of 115kg at 6'1 I was struggling to run 5k in 35 minutes. When lock-down started I took it as a great opportunity to create a solid routine and have dropped to 96.6kg as of yesterday, mostly through CICO. I wanted to increase my runs per week but, going all out most runs, I found it really hard to run more than 2 days in a row. I stumbled across low-HR training and really liked the idea of slowly down, enjoying the runs, and still supposedly seeing the benefits. I was convinced mostly by a [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MALsI0mJ09I) by Stephen Seiler on the benefits of training mostly low intensity. I was also helped out a lot on this subreddit, so thank you to the many redditors who answered my questions!

I based my training mostly off MAF (180-age is your target max HR during a run), 151bpm for me. I know it's not massively scientific but runs felt great at that HR, even if I was slowing to a walk for the first few weeks. It felt like I was solidly in my aerobic zone. The idea is as your aerobic fitness improves you will be able to increase your pace whilst keeping a low HR, and be less susceptible to injury and fatigue not going all out. It was a bit of an epiphany for me that running slower can make you fitter, but thought it was worth a short.

For reference when running regularly last year I would call 5:45min/km a high intensity pace I could only keep up for 5km.  Over the next 12 weeks I built up my distances not worrying to much about pace, and by week 5 I started to see a great improvement in pace at the same HR. I began at around 7min/km 12 weeks ago and by last week was at 5:59/km average. It was so satisfying finding I could run faster without feeling like i'd done much more work. I know I've been very lucky in that many people find this training takes 6 months minimum, I saw good results in 3. Being cynical you could probably argue the fact I was increasing my mileage was having a much bigger impact on my pace than low-HR training, but if nothing else running slowly meant I could go from 50km a month to 210km whilst feeling not much fatigue. 

I ran every run 'easy pace'/under 151bpm (occasionally over) for 12 weeks. 5 days a week, building up to 55km a week. I didn't introduce any speed work, though I will in the next few weeks. My longest training run was 17km. 

Overall I didn't plan nearly as much as I should have for a 1/2 marathon race, but I knew I had the mileage down and I wanted to test out the low-HR training results for the last 3 months. As I was doing this solo I wasn't so worried if I had to bail out with tiredness, so that helped me push and not hold back. 

My prior PB for half marathon was 2:11, 2018, Greater Manchester Marathon. Training for that was 2 hard runs a week, and a long easy run. Not enough knowledge or understanding of training principles at all. 


### Pre-race
Went for a nice walk at lunch, had a small dinner at 17:30 and starting running at 20:30! Wife's birthday dinner the night before acted as carb load. 

### Race
KM 1-5
After 12 weeks running with my eyes fixed on my HR monitor it felt amazing to forget all that and just run. I had missed it and I had to stop myself from going too quickly! I tried to hit 5:42min/km to hit a 2 hour finish time. Felt comfortable and happy. 

KM 6-14
Feeling great and endorphins rushing to the head I decided to pick up the pace a bit, and took it below 5:15min/km. Not my best idea, and I paid for it later in the race. I'm terrible at pacing myself, and it's even harder without a pacemaker. Felt good up until km 12 though, before starting to lag. 

KM 15-20
Shortly before KM 15 I had a horrible realisation it was nearly 10pm on a Sunday, I had forgotten to bring any water and had forgotten a mask to enter a shop. As soon as I realised that, of course I started to feel dehydrated and headache appeared. I remembered a public water fountain about 2.5km away and rerouted to head there. 

It was during this period that I hit the wall twice, getting a bad stitch and having to slow down to nearly walking pace. An old shoulder injury also appeared for good measure and I grunted and squealed my way through residential streets at 10pm at night. I can't imagine how it sounded to anyone with the window open... This close to finishing and on track for a PB it would have taken my leg to fall off for me to stop and I managed to keep going. 

KM 20
Hitting the last mile is always magical in a long distance race, the pain fell away and I managed the last mile as close to a sprint as I could get to, reaching 4:25min/km in KM 20! I crossed the line and kept going for 200m just to make sure Strava would register the half marathon distance. 


### Post-race
Felt super happy, not only did I hit sub-2 hour 1/2 marathon but I got a 10km PB to boot at 55 minutes! Best of all I felt I had I had another 3-4 minutes in me, and will definitely be attempting a 10km PB attempt next week, aiming for 50 minutes. 

I can't stress enough how satisfied I've been with the low-HR training, it enabled me to run longer, enjoy my runs, stay injury free, and see a dramatic increase in my endurance. I know it's nothing revolutionary but I feel a lot of casual runners like me assumed that if you want to get faster you need to exclusively be pushing yourself as hard as you can. No Pain No Gain and all that (yes I watched the Stephen Seiler TED talk, you should too). This has completely reserved that mentality for me. I know I will need to introduce speed work to keep improving, but I couldn't be happier and more into my running as I am now.

We live in Chicago so we have hot summers and heading into a cold winter. He runs on a paved path in the city. He’s 6’1, 185lbs and seems to overheat easily. He basically needs everything- tops, bottoms, socks, accessories, etc. Any recommendations? (Links to amazon would be appreciated)&lt;/p&gt;

| C | 40 minutes or under? | \*No\* |

| D | Beat my partner? | \*Yes\* |

&amp;#x200B;

\### Training

I had been trying to run a few times a week since I got my new running watch for Christmas. It was getting a little rough right before we went into lockdown in March, I just didn't have the time to fit in runs with my job (teacher) and my kids. (Especially after track season started, because my partner coaches, leaving me to handle all after school activities until he got home.) But after we went into lockdown, I started getting very consistent in my running schedule. I ended up taking most of May off due to an injury, and then the summer was sort of sporadic what with vacations and the oppressive summer heat. For the past month I upped my weekly mileage and my pace, knowing that I was going to get to run in an actual race Labor Day weekend. My training was solely roads, though. The last time I trail ran was in March.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

The USNWC decided to open the course at 7 AM and close it at 3 PM. We were able to enter and run at any time. The starting line wasn't as crowded as it usually is, but there were quite a few people milling about. There were people there cheering runners as they crossed the finish line, and with the music playing it had the same feeling as a regular race. I wore my mask up until I crossed the start line, because safety first. When my partner looked at me and said, ""Are you ready? Let's go,"" I actually teared up a little bit. We missed about four of our usual Spring and Summer races, and every time we'd hear that one was cancelled it felt like we may never actually run in a race again. It just felt so good to be back in that pre-race atmosphere again that I almost didn't want to leave to start the race.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Since it was the first time I'd been on a train in months, I wasn't planning on breaking any records. I wanted to run strong, and I told myself that I shouldn't be longer than 40 minutes. One of the first things I realized was that I missed the toe spread I have in my road shoes, Altra Escalante Racers. I wear Merrell Trail Gloves for trail, and suddenly I felt like they really too tight and glove-like. I'm definitely going to try a pair of Altra trail shoes before the next trail race.

I had never run a trail racer with a staggered start, and it was glorious. There was no bottlenecking on the trail, which was good because this course was on a very narrow trail. Most places required you to get off the trail to let someone pass, which is always a struggle when you start in a large group. There were people running on the trail, I was passed a few times and I passed some people. Early on I realized that everyone who passed me was giving me some encouragement as they ran by. This was the first race for most of us since quarantine, and you could really feel the community. I made sure to say something positive to the people I passed, just wanting to pass on the good feeling. That was what the race was about to me, just feeling good about being out running with others.

After I saw my second split, I decided I was going to have to reassess my goal of 40 minutes. I was going MUCH slower on the trail than I had anticipated. I think several things contributed to me being slow: first time on a trail since March; a very narrow, tight, and tree root-y trail; and not having my usual landmarks to pace off. I told myself that I could be happy with 45 minutes, as long as I finished strong. I knew the last bit towards the finish line is a hill, and after I left the woods I reminded myself I had trained for this by running up a much steeper hill in my neighborhood at the end of my runs, so there were no excuses. I glanced at my watch as I got closer and saw it was under 40. I knew I couldn't clear the hill in one minute, but I was going to be close. I crossed the finish line feeling good about myself, which is not how I usually cross the finish line.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

I got water and waited for my partner. This was the first race we've ever run where I've beat him. I don't feel particularly proud of that because he hasn't been training at all, but he never really does any sort of training and he still always beats me. I think it boils down to stride length, so even if I'm in better shape I can't outrun him.

We hung out and watched some of Team USA canoe and kayak on their training runs on the whitewater, then we had a beer. We went to lunch at a brewery, and then home for a nap. 

I was hoping to run today, but I woke up with very stiff and wonky knees. It's probably a result of trail running and the fact I missed a week with my RA medicine. So I'll be back out tomorrow morning, early, before my first day of virtual teaching. I have a feeling teaching virtually is going to mean my weekly mileage dramatically increases, because I just can't sit in front of a computer for very long without losing my mind. 

Cheers to everyone who ran this weekend!

I glanced at my watch as I got closer and saw it was under 40. I knew I couldn&amp;#39;t clear the hill in one minute, but I was going to be close. I crossed the finish line feeling good about myself, which is not how I usually cross the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Post-race&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got water and waited for my partner. This was the first race we&amp;#39;ve ever run where I&amp;#39;ve beat him. I don&amp;#39;t feel particularly proud of that because he hasn&amp;#39;t been training at all, but he never really does any sort of training and he still always beats me. I think it boils down to stride length, so even if I&amp;#39;m in better shape I can&amp;#39;t outrun him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hung out and watched some of Team USA canoe and kayak on their training runs on the whitewater, then we had a beer. We went to lunch at a brewery, and then home for a nap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to run today, but I woke up with very stiff and wonky knees. It&amp;#39;s probably a result of trail running and the fact I missed a week with my RA medicine. So I&amp;#39;ll be back out tomorrow morning, early, before my first day of virtual teaching. I have a feeling teaching virtually is going to mean my weekly mileage dramatically increases, because I just can&amp;#39;t sit in front of a computer for very long without losing my mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers to everyone who ran this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

I was curious to know if it is a bad sign if I have lower shin tension/soreness for the first 10 minutes of running ( I do 4 min run/1 min walk as I just started 2 weeks ago) but this gradually goes away and I'm able to run normally with no sort of pain. At first I was worried it was shin splits but there are a couple of differences this time: 1) No pain when I am walking the minute. When I developed shin splint even the 1 minute walk caused a sharp pain in my lower shin but I feel completely fine when walking. 2) There is no pain after my session. When I had shin splints the pain after my sessions would cause me to have to sit down it was so bad. After my runs now I feel fine. 3) No pain the next day. The worst part of having shin splints in the past was having to drag my bad foot everywhere :) Now my shins feel completely fine the next day. Is this normal when first starting to run?

I'm a newer runner. I started jogging 3-4 times a week about 4 months ago and am now 4-5 days a week for 3-5 miles at a time. I always run on trails, though usually well-maintained park trails. This last week I went for a 3.5 mi trail run on rougher terrain and one long run (4 mi) on pavement. The pavement run murdered my feet. I broke two metatarsal bones in February and could actually feel the area around the old break complaining, so I cut the run short and walked home.

Since then, my calf muscles have just been pissed off at me. I've had to run shorter distances, and I could barely make it through 3 rounds of 1 mile intervals today. It seems to be the lower part of my calf. I do stretches after my run about half the time, and I also self-massage after every run. I take magnesium to help with cramping too.

Firstly, the race was supposed to be in May and got rescheduled to today. Along with rescheduling the race, the actual course and start time got moved as well. 

The race incorporated a 5k, half, and full marathon. In order to social distance the race was changed to the entire weekend, September 5-7. 5k and half marathon runners were to run Saturday or Monday, with marathoners running on Sunday. Each runner registered online for a start time. Runners could sign up from 5AM to 11AM, with five runners allowed to sign up in each five minute increment. If runners felt uncomfortable, they were allowed to sign up virtual and submit their time between August 1st and September 7th. 

Due to the race being changed to over 3 days, the course itself changed as well. This was due to the original race being on part of a public road, which they couldn’t shut down for 3 days. The course was changed to a local, beautiful running trail with a similar elevation change. 

Packet pick ups were offered over 5 days at different locations to promote social distancing. In order to avoid personal contact at the end of the race, finisher medals and t-shirts were provided during this time. 

Aid stations handed out full, sealed water and Gatorade bottles, along with gels. Runners were not allowed to stop at stations but needed to continue to walk to avoid crowding. 

Once finished, snack bags were provided for quick grab-and-go to get people in and out. Due to the different start times and virtual option, no placement awards were given.

Hello fellow runners,

I have been a road runner since long and have started trail running off late. I am yet to buy a trail running shoe. For road running, I use the Asics Gel Kayano 23 (may need an upgrade). Now, as I am new to trail running, I have been looking for some shoes online and my friend recommended Altra Timp 2.0. Now after reading several reviews online I am unsure if they would be the best fit for me.
The most common complain is: ‘narrow around the mid-sole’ , ‘need time to break in’, ‘boxy toes’. 
I had Skechers Go Meb Speed 4 a couple of years back and they were also too tight around mid sole and were very uncomfortable for me. So, don’t want to fall into that trap again.

TDLR: I love the comfort feeling of the Asics Gel Kayanos and am looking for something similar in the Altra trail running shoes. So any suggestions or recommendations are most welcome.

,running,"hi, I've been running for quite a few months and I had broken a sub 25 quite a while ago. I can now run an all out 5k in the 23 minute ranges even if I don't run for a while. I haven't had a proper plan for running, started off with quick easy runs at the start of my journey and I have been experimenting also incorporating longer and slower runs. 

anyways as a kid I used to be active but during my teenage years I really fell off and lived an extremely stationary life. I'm 18 now and I'm trying to pay more attention to my body. I think I've noticed that my core is like EXTREMELY weak. it's something I've always never paid attention to. when running I've noticed my body posture is a bit flimsy as the miles pile on and I have to correct it quite a lot. also if I do any type of sprints or run at a fast pace I've noticed that I kind of sink downwards? I'm not tall at all but I've seen that like my body goes lower down towards gravity especially when sprinting? I dunno if that made sense at all. it's like my legs are slowly sinking into the ground as I reach the end of a sprint/fast paced run (I don't think it's due to weak legs as I train these regularly)

well as soon as I heard that I could possibly have a weak core I immediately did some core excercises just to check it out (like some ab workouts) and most of the pain from the workouts hurt my lower back.

I'm wondering how can I tell if my core is weak? how can I I prove it to make it extremely strong? I also would like to know how much of an impact would it make for running and improving my 5k time? like does it matter a lot or does it provide some benefits but not a lot (this is not negating the importance of having a strong core I'm just curious on the impact it can have)

I was very into weight training, judo(for competition), and boxing(heavy-bag training, maybe light sparring for a trustworthy partner, 0% tolerance for head trauma) in high school, but had not run distance, perhaps strides or swimming for a workout. With appropriate training how long do you think it would take to run a 5min mile. I am well aware of what an adequate training regimen would consist of. Do you think my DIII college cross country team would allow me to run with them if I showed dedication (I'm aware I'm not exactly a cross country stud haha). Any help would be greatly appreciated. But mostly what I'd like to no is this: how long until I hit the 5:00 min mile?
