,Swimming,"I'm a paramedic.

Last night, on duty, we were called to a local gym and indoor pool facility for a teenager found drowned in the pool.

He was alone. Nobody knew how long he'd been under. Some gym goers walking by noticed he was just floating under the water and grabbed him out. 

They did CPR, and thankfully, by the time I got there, he was wide awake but in a lot of pain. 

He admitted to me later that he was trying to swim long lengths underwater and his last memory was trying to come up for air and then nothing. 

He experienced a shallow water blackout. Essentially, when you are trying to do long distances underwater, you can hyperventilate to maximize your oxygen intake and blow off much of your CO2, thus reducing the feeling of 'i need to surface for air' during your laps. 

But what ends up happening sometimes, is that you overdo it, and you end up expelling too much CO2. Then, as you are doing your lap, your brain becomes oxygen deprived, but the CO2 level in your body is too low for your brain to signal you to breath. 

And, without any warning, lights go out. No slow fade into darkness, no slow feeling of passing out. No, you pretty much just go out in a matter of seconds.

...

At the hospital, my patient's father expressed shock to me that this happened to his kid. His kid is an incredible competitive swimmer, one of the best in his age group. It didn't make sense that he nearly drowned. He could understand some rookie, but his kid? In a pool that was maybe 5 feet deep? 

I told him yes, his kid, in a shallow pool, surrounded by other people. He almost lost his life before he even started it in earnest.

,Swimming,"So I just got out of practice and I need to vent. After an hour of dry land, we hopped in the pool and did ours warmup. We did a long pre set, and moved on. For the first part of our main set, our coach had us do a 500 kick followed by a 1,000 freestyle swim. Nasty stuff especially bc I’m a sprinter. Im a 100 into this kick when I see a kid I havnt seen come into practice for a while. He sneaks down the stairs, puts down his bag, and dives into the pool “stealthily.” This guy does a 50 and then grabs my leg in the water while I’m going the opposite way. He asks me what set we are doing, and tells me that he skipped the first 60% of practice bc he didn’t feel like going. 

I roll my eyes, tell him the set, and start swimming. This happened quickly so I wasn’t even a 300 into the kick when he drops his kickboard and starts the freestyle. Coach yells, “hey, ____ did you do the kick?” “Ya coach I just lapped everyone else.”  Whatever, not my business, just keep swimming. He is going faster than me know because he is swimming and I am kicking. He swims up behind me. Now, it’s been different at other places I swam, but for the most part I think that when you want to pass someone, you tap them on the leg. This kid grabs my leg, yanks it backwards, puts his other arm on my shoulder, and pulls himself foreword over me. Then, he kicks me in the chin (prob by accident but still) and swims off. Not even an “oops.” I’m fuming, and ready to yell at him. I continue doing my kick, and he comes up behind me one more time. 

And I couldn’t believe it, but he did it again! Not sure if I’m describing it great but if it was on land it would be considered a tackle. I stood up in the water, grabbed his legs, and said “hey jackass, don’t do that again” which is really uncharacteristic for me bc I usually don’t curse unless I’m very close to the person. And damn the audacity of this bitch. He looks me straight in the eye and says “Hey man, don’t hate just because I’m faster.” Iv never wanted to slap a guy more then I did right than.

,Swimming,"Hey, very new to this reddit. I’m having a bit of confusion with regards to pool etiquette etc. 
I have recently started swimming again, mainly in the evenings but now due to work I try and swim during the day.

It wasn’t a MASSIVE problem before and I have only ever got frustrated a couple of times. 

But today I got so frustrated I had to leave the pool completely and went for a run. 

So because I have switched to day time swimming there are a lot more mums (like me) but I would call them the ‘social swimmers’; mainly swimming in breast stroke two abreast having conversations with their heads completely out of the water practically “swimming” vertically. A few are the older ladies but ya know if you’re slow, you are slow and I will wait a reasonable distance till I set off from the side of the pool. 

Then there are the REALLY fast swimmers. Mainly men and a couple of very athletic ladies. However due to their only being three lanes (two fast and one slow) the majority of people are in the slow lane so today I was swimming in a slow lane with about 9 people. 

My question is: as I am still relatively slow (not slow slow) and I am swimming for fitness and training should I try and get into the fast lane? Or should I just go back to trying to swim in the evenings when pools are quieter? 

I’m really struggling because I’m so “inbetween” the paces. I’m not slow and I’m not as fast as others.

,Swimming,"Hey Swimming Reddit,

I wanted to make a quick post to celebrate that I'm up to swimming 1200m in 30 mins! It's certainly not fast for those of you who have trained but I'm so proud of myself. I swam competitively when I was 10 for a year and that's the only training I've had. I'm now nearly 30 (yikes) and only really getting back into swimming. About 2 years ago, I tried to swim again, and was struggling to hit 600m in an hour. So feeling accomplished and I don't have anyone to share it with. 

Recently, I took up freediving and love the feeling of powering through the water with my fins. It just feels right. I'm excited to get my swimming up to speed (maybe not fin speed though) and the endurance for swimming and diving.

I'm very fortunate - I have a gorgeous Olympic-sized open-air pool less than 10 m from my office that is completely free for me to swim in and I shall be making the most of it. Today we had a torrential downpour and it was very soul-soothing to swim amongst the raindrops.

,Swimming,"Hello Reddit! 

I am a high school JV athlete and I want to train on my own in anticipation of varsity tryouts this year. It's my senior year, and so its really important to me that I make it this year.

I talked to my coach, and here are the 2 criteria for making the team:

1. Complete 10 x 100 yards on a 1:30 interval (don't miss any intervals)
2. develop a general endurance to get through a 2-4000 yard 90-minute intense varsity practice

Unfortunately, where I live, I cannot join my local swim club due to COVID restraints. 

As a result, I must go out on my own to force my self to workout out to make tryouts. 

My motivation is pretty good, and my tolerance for working out is moderately high, but I definitely don't have any remarkable ability to swim crazy workouts. Especially right now as I am out of shape.

I have done some work, and here is the kind of workouts I have completed: 

* 100 warmup
* 10 x 100 on the 1:55 
* cooldown
* \*\*felts pretty easy going. \~70% difficulty

My past PRs:

50: 26 low

100: \~103

500: 7:16

(all freestyle)

I hope this gives enough information. **Can you please advise me on how to think about planning my workouts and maybe point me in the direction of a workout plan?**

Constraints: 

1. I would like to be in the water for 30-60 minutes give or take
2. I do not have many extra pieces of equipment. Only a cap and goggles.

\- Sharing a lane - when somebody says to pick a side does it to start at one side and essentially swim in a circle clockwise/anti-clockwise, or pretty much split the lane and stick to one side (e.g. if you pick right, you right hand is next to the edge forwards and when you turn around it's your left hand next to the edge) kind of annoying to explain without drawing.  
\- When sharing a lane - do you kick off at the end of the land or do a turnaround? (I just find those flip kick offs like something fun to do, but don't want to annoy anyone)

,Swimming,"Ok, so first of all thanks for the information I got from the previous post, which was really helpful. 

Now, I basically try to swim to burn off fat every day (with moderate success). However! It wasn't until recently that I realized how much I actually suck at this (a year or so of experience, half a dozen training sessions with a coach). 

All my life I've been swimming without much effort so I'm used to more or less doing a few laps at a medium pace and then going back to slow. And just last week I remembered something my friend said who swims for the state: ""What you're doing isn't swimming. I'm ""swimming"" swimming"". My grandfather could do what you're doing."" So at the time, I didn't pay much attention thinking she was just teasing me. And the last time at the lake it was sort of like pieces of a puzzle came together and I tried imagining I'm a competitive swimmer and really giving it my everything. 

10 minutes and 2 collapsed lungs later (joking, no animals were harmed during the making of this), staggering home, I was thinking this was the best and the worst day of my life ever. That time I really felt like I've achieved something. I actually felt like I was building muscle too, plus the next day, looking in the mirror I was like - whoa. The upper part of my body actually got bigger (not a lot, but the changes were quantifiable) and I literally lost a little weight overnight. Which was hugely motivating. So I'm gonna keep it up. 

The problem here is that for some reason swimming really takes it out of me. Maybe I'm just really unfit but as soon as I finish training even as I'm walking home I feel exhausted but not just on a physical level. My motivation goes down, and it's really hard to get out of bed the next morning. And that was the lazy way!

That day when I went Sonic for the next two days I was **really** tired. It was just awful. I don't know how you people do it. The worst part is that morale kind of drops, and doing everything is harder. 

Any recommendations on how to recover better? Like literally anything. Good food and mediation help. Maybe I should take a couple of hours every day and just read a book in bed instead of running around like a lunatic doing stuff all the time. 

Anyway, any advice will be appreciated.

My grandfather could do what you&amp;#39;re doing.&amp;quot; So at the time, I didn&amp;#39;t pay much attention thinking she was just teasing me. And the last time at the lake it was sort of like pieces of a puzzle came together and I tried imagining I&amp;#39;m a competitive swimmer and really giving it my everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 minutes and 2 collapsed lungs later (joking, no animals were harmed during the making of this), staggering home, I was thinking this was the best and the worst day of my life ever. That time I really felt like I&amp;#39;ve achieved something. I actually felt like I was building muscle too, plus the next day, looking in the mirror I was like - whoa. The upper part of my body actually got bigger (not a lot, but the changes were quantifiable) and I literally lost a little weight overnight. Which was hugely motivating. So I&amp;#39;m gonna keep it up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that for some reason swimming really takes it out of me. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just really unfit but as soon as I finish training even as I&amp;#39;m walking home I feel exhausted but not just on a physical level. My motivation goes down, and it&amp;#39;s really hard to get out of bed the next morning. And that was the lazy way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That day when I went Sonic for the next two days I was &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; tired. It was just awful. I don&amp;#39;t know how you people do it. The worst part is that morale kind of drops, and doing everything is harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any recommendations on how to recover better? Like literally anything. Good food and mediation help. Maybe I should take a couple of hours every day and just read a book in bed instead of running around like a lunatic doing stuff all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, any advice will be appreciated. Ciao!&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"I was always a side breather in butterfly. I would breathe and keep one goggle in the water exactly like in freestyle. People were always amazed at how low I breathed. My breathing was so low people would ask me ""why didn't you breathe?"" I was the only person I'd met that breathed like that. I know other people do it too, but I never met or saw anyone that did it. I always felt that I was able to have a longer and more relaxed breath than anyone else. Sometimes I would even leave my head to the side and breathe every stroke without any effort. The natural rise in butterfly would give me enough lift to open my mouth to breathe.  

&amp;#x200B;

I took a long break from swimming and found that I can't do it as well anymore. I've been breathing to the front and have found it easier than attempting to breathe to the side. But I'm a little confused as to when exactly to breathe. I've been experimenting with the timing of my breath. I've tried lifting my chin right before the start of my pull, and the rise from my undulation gets my head just high enough to breathe. I've also experimented with lifting my chin during my second kick to breathe during the downbeat of my kick.

&amp;#x200B;

Butterfly has always been my best stroke/event. I think it's because I could have a very fast tempo because I could just keep my head to the side and not move my head until it was time for a turn. I've found it harder to pick up my tempo with the change of my breathing style. So I'm still practicing breathing to the side but want to perfect my front breathing. Which way is correct? During what phase of my pull and kick should I be breathing when breathing to the front?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an experienced swimmer, and butterfly is by far my fastest stroke. My technique is still pretty good. I know how to swim butterfly properly, but this change in breathing is challenging me. I want to swim a USMS meet when things return to a relative state of normalcy.

,Swimming,"I've been lap swimming extremely casually for about two years after teaching myself to swim. My swimming before that would be what I would consider 'not drowning.' It's taken a long time, but I am finally starting to feel comfortable in the water and would like to get more serious about my swimming. 

My first question is there a good two-piece swim suit that is good for women? I don't feel comfortable with the one-piece styles that don't have some kind of shorts. I've seen posts about jammers. Do they make those for women?

Second, is there a good strategy for practicing flip turns? I did them for about a month about a year ago but every time I did, I would have to hold my nose to do the turns or just have a ton of water forced up my nose. 

Finally, is there like a pre-prescribed go to pre or post-workout food that I should have? I played soccer in high school and my coach was constantly reminding us to eat bananas, so I was wondering if the same strategy applied to swimming. I feel like I never workout at the pool at a consistent time, just whenever I can fit it into my work schedule.

&lt;p&gt;I just missed the feeling of competing thus gonna try to regain back my strength and if ever I get to compete here in the states it would be my first here and would be one check off my bucket list : )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other advice such as training etc would be appreciated! : )&lt;/p&gt;

I was on a lake 3 hours ago, I swam just a little and I did a lots of jumping, let's say around 8 jumps from 3 m and around 6 jumps from 5m but they were all feet first.

The pain is not that painful but when I swallow I hear a beat in my left ear and now when Im laying down something is moving in the ear, like the water that wants to come out but I can't sens any water at all and when I jump to get it out nothing is happening.

,Swimming,"I've seen several people post about using swimming for weight loss, so I figured I'd post my story and progress of where I am about 1 month in.  Included are some before/after photos.

I was always an athletic person growing up and always in very good shape.  I played multiple sports through high school and post high school and was in the Marine Corps.  At some point in life I really hit a wall when it came to keeping myself active and physically fit.  It became easier and easier to live a sedentary lifestyle and I became less and less fit and didn't care that much for myself at all.  About  a month ago I was feeling really low.  My self esteem was down, I was feeling depressed, I was drinking pretty heavily, and I was lying to myself that I was fine and living happily.  Like many people during the pandemic my activity level decreased significantly, even though I was pretty sedentary as it was.  Mentally and physically I just wasn't healthy.

On July 17th I went to the doctor to have a nagging knee injury checked out which made it even harder to get back active.  While at the doctor they weighed me and the scale read 239 lbs.  This is almost the heaviest I've weighed when visiting the doctor.  At that point I decided I needed to do something.  My knee was not getting better by just sitting around, in fact it was getting worse and I know the extra weight did not help, and I was turning 40 in a few days.  So the following Monday I joined a gym with a pool and went for my first swim on my birthday.  Since that day I have been swimming on all but a handful of days.  On my first day I could only go 25 yds before having to take a break.  I can now do several hundred yards without stopping and have significantly improved on my freestyle and breaststroke.  Not only has swimming helped me physically, it has put me in such a better place mentally. 

Now for a few stats.  On 7/21 I weighed myself at home on my own scale wearing nothing.  On that date I weighed 232.5 lbs (obviously fully clothed with shoes at the Drs. Office adds a few lbs..haha).  On 7/27 I decided to start taking weekly photos of myself to track my progress and also started taking body measurements.  I didn't want the scale to be my only motivator.  In addition to the swimming I started to be more conscious of the food and drinks I was putting in my body and cut out all soda, significantly reduced and limited my alcohol intake, and started eating a lower carb diet.  I also have been taking bike rides with my family on the weekends.

This morning I weighed myself and took my weekly pictures and really looked at them to see how far I've came.  I'm only about a 3rd of the way where I want to be weight wise, but I am very proud of where I am at compared to just a little over a month ago.  Today I weighed in at 214.3 lbs and have lost a total of 4.5 inches from my stomach, waist, and hips.  The pictures show a before and after of where I started, compared to where I am today.  The one thing that doesn't show up in the stats or pictures though is how much better off I am now both mentally and emotionally, and I owe a very large part of that to deciding to get back in the pool.  The physical aspects are nice and all, but the mental aspect make it all worth it to me.

,Swimming,"I have three kids, all of which who have been in swimming lessons since they could walk. Where we live there's tons of water around and obviously, it's a necessary skill.

All my kids progressed wonderfully but when my daughter was seven years old, already a competent swimmer at the time, she was swimming into the deepest part of the lake when another swimmer, a twelve-year-old boy who was just learning how to swim for the first time, started drowning in the middle of the lake. In panic he grabbed onto her and she was shoved in. Both kids started drowning, way out in the lake. The boy had had a life belt on but I think in his panic he took it off so he could hold onto it and float but it popped out of his hands and floated away. 

I wasn't there at the time and the shorter part of the lake was only about a hundred feet across so she swam across a lot. They were alone in the lake and they were both falling underwater. The boy's dad noticed first that he couldn't see his kid, at this point they had already been struggling for a few minutes. He dove in and he went looking for them, he managed to grab them both and he took them to shore. Both had to be resuscitated. '

Ever since then, my daughter refused to touch water. There was a time where she'd have panic attacks in the shower and bath and even washing her hair. We took her to therapy and she improved to the point where she was able to bathe comfortably again but she was still absolutely terrified of the water. She's been to a collection of different therapists but she still has a severe fear of water and refuses to go anywhere near it. 

She recently just turned sixteen and finally was coaxed into her grandfather's backyard pool a few months ago. She stayed in the shallow end and tried to swim but she's lost the ability and wasn't able to even float. The therapist had been making a little headway in getting her back into the water but now she says if she can't swim, there's no point in ever going back to the water. Somehow, even though the fear was subsiding, it's come back a lot harder and now she's back to never touching the water.

I'm really out of options here. We've tried therapy, counselling, gradually easing her into water but none of it works. Last year we had to cancel our Disney cruise because she vehemently refused to go on a ship in the middle of the ocean. She said we were free to go ourselves but of course I'm not going to leave her on her own while the rest of the family has fun.

,Swimming,"I've been trying to do flip turns for a while.

While doing breaststroke it's fine.

But during front crawl....I just can't seem to do it.

The issue is breathing. During breaststroke I feel when I'm close enough to the wall, I have enough breath to flip, change direction and swim to the surface for my next breath going the opposite way. But.

During front crawl I always feel like I'm just a little bit too far from the wall to get a good last minute breath....I breathe every 3rd ""rotation"" (tried 2s as well but same issue). So I'm spending more time under water. Take last breath, swim a little further, flip, change direction, scramble to the surface and start swimming in opposite direction....

Is it just a case of - You gotta learn to hold your breath for longer to help you with that slight disparity in distance from the wall compared to breaststroke? Like you won't always be perfectly in right place at your last breath?

,Swimming,"Hello everyone, :)

Curious if anyone experiences severe abdominal swelling during and after swimming, and, during any physical exertion. Many years ago while exercising by myself (cycling), I felt something heavy in the area between my sternum and navel. I was not doing anything strenuous like intervals or race pace training. The heaviness made physical efforts a bit harder and I could not belly breath as deeply because something felt ""in the way"" in that area. During this time my body weight increased by 15 pounds within a month with no changes to diet, sleep or exercise. Over the years, the swelling would get more pronounced, especially after every bowel movement and any amount of exercise, even 10 minutes. Body weight continued to gradually increase (have more overall puffiness rather than being lean like before).

It has reached the point that I had to stop swimming and other aerobic exercise because my abdomen would get swollen like a lady four to six months pregnant. I've had many labs and tests and everything came back normal. I ruled out it being food related because I experience the pregnant swelling no matter what foods I  eat. I also experience the swelling even drinking water. I also don't eliminate as much water considering the amount I drink throughout the day. It feels like my body is retaining everything I drink rather than eliminating it like it did before the onset of these symptoms.

It has been a mystery that many doctors I've seen over the years (medical and naturopathic) cannot find a root cause for the extreme swelling after exercise and bowel movements.

I'm not a professional swimmer or teacher, so I don't know how he can improve his technique further. I can see what is wrong and give him feedback and say how he should do it, for example his arm movement are way too exaggerated.

,Swimming,"For those that would like some variation and/or a more structured workout, I provide for you our groups workout from today. Our workouts are split into 5 different skill levels. Choose the column that works best for you and if you find that you are consistently getting more rest than column 5, move up a level. Because this is Masters, feel free to add/subtract/or modify in anyway you see fit.

Notes for this set:

Not saying I went into a river and dove in and all
I was just at my friends party playing volleyball and all with around a crowd of like 15-20 people and I noticed they had a pool and saw it was shallow given i saw my friend able to stand on it (he was like 6'2) and I thought hey ill take a quick dip just to cool off before I leave as it was getting into sunset anyway by the time I went into the pool my friend went to drink water and get his stuff as i was his ride meaning i was the only one in the pool and I was just vibing in the left half of the pool but what I didn't realize is the right half was deep lile I wanma say 10 feet deep cause  as soon as I drifted over to the right half I didn't feel the bottom of the pool and instantly freaked out and dude that shit did not feel good. Drowning legit was terrifying i swallowed so much water and i think my issue was I freaked out. I somehow, someway managed to reach the top of the water and yell for help but ended up freaking out and fell into the deep end and idk why but my muscles ached so bad and my right leg suddenly hurt so bad I couldn't even stretch it to move up and legit felt so scared and was so angry at my self for being this stupid and then suddenly I got pulled out by my friend deshawn and Alex (fake names) as she and him slowly put it together that I was drowning. 

I was grateful my homies were there for me and all but i was just angry on the drive home (also cause my lungs burned for odd reason. Maybe the chlorine pool water or something). I felt embarrassed is all
I was just some little kid yelling for help being saved and all and I for sure would of died and I wont have it.

I am looking to purchase a new swim cap for a girl and her hair is reaching her hips. I have read a lot of sources but still confuse that what work and what does not.   


So, I come across a guide on [large swim caps](https://sportlia.com/best-swim-caps-for-long-hair/), and there are ten different choices. What do you think will work? and what are your views and thoughts on that?  


What swim caps are you using right now for your long hair?

Also, if there is any swim cap that you are using now and keeping your hair dry, then please suggest me that because I don't want her hair to get because the chlorine can have bad impact on them. 

Any suggestions will appreciated!

,Swimming,"Hey everyone

I'm a 27M cyclist who likes to run trails and is going for his first triathlon (70.3) next summer. This means I'll be swimming a lot the coming months/years and I've got some questions.

I live in the mountains and there's not a lot of pools in the area that stay open outside of the summer months (june, july and august). I have access to one pool (25 meter) that is covered and I'll be going there once per week to swim. I'm also looking to get at least a few sessions with a swim coach to work on proper form in freestyle.

Still, one session per week seems a bit low for my goal (half Ironman next summer). However, with the pool 45 minutes drive from my home, it would take too long to go multiple times per week. That's why I was thinking about supplementing this training with 1 or 2 sessions on a tether in a small intex-type pool. I'd put down some mirrors so I could focus on improving technique. Of course this would only be possible as long as the weather permits. Even if I swim with my wetsuit.

Is this a good course of action or will swimming with a tether mess up my novice technique? Any thoughts or tips on improving with so little access to a pool? There's also the possibility of swimming in the river (narrow river with some nice spots to swim against the current), but again, only as long as the weather permits and when there's not too many kayaks on the water.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 27M cyclist who likes to run trails and is going for his first triathlon (70.3) next summer. This means I&amp;#39;ll be swimming a lot the coming months/years and I&amp;#39;ve got some questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in the mountains and there&amp;#39;s not a lot of pools in the area that stay open outside of the summer months (june, july and august). I have access to one pool (25 meter) that is covered and I&amp;#39;ll be going there once per week to swim. I&amp;#39;m also looking to get at least a few sessions with a swim coach to work on proper form in freestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, one session per week seems a bit low for my goal (half Ironman next summer). However, with the pool 45 minutes drive from my home, it would take too long to go multiple times per week. That&amp;#39;s why I was thinking about supplementing this training with 1 or 2 sessions on a tether in a small intex-type pool. I&amp;#39;d put down some mirrors so I could focus on improving technique. Of course this would only be possible as long as the weather permits. Even if I swim with my wetsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a good course of action or will swimming with a tether mess up my novice technique? Any thoughts or tips on improving with so little access to a pool? There&amp;#39;s also the possibility of swimming in the river (narrow river with some nice spots to swim against the current), but again, only as long as the weather permits and when there&amp;#39;s not too many kayaks on the water.&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"My spouse is required to pass a swim test for a job they have applied to. Neither of us are swimmers. I'm wondering if passing this swim test (requirements below) is possible, knowing that they have 1 month to train for it.

First test: The candidate must swim one hundred (100) metres without stopping, using a forward facing 
swim stroke and without any swim aids such as dive masks, fins, snorkel or flotation device. 
Stopping or standing up in the shallow end of the pool at any point during the exercise will 
constitute a failure of this evolution.

Second test: Using no swim aids and wearing only a swimsuit, the candidate will stay afloat in a vertical 
position by treading water, drown proofing, bobbing or floating for fifteen (15) minutes, with 
hands out of the water for the last two (2) minutes. 

My spouse seems less concerned about the 100 meter swim, and more concerned about the treading water. We did a dry run without looking into techniques or anything and they were able to tread water for about 6 minutes.

We've since discovered the eggbeater, which we hope might help.

We don't really have regular access to a pool (due to COVID) or body of water, so we're trying to figure out what kind of an in-the-water schedule they'll need to train so we can work out some kind of arrangement.

Is there anything they can do outside of the pool to help?

swim stroke and without any swim aids such as dive masks, fins, snorkel or flotation device. 
Stopping or standing up in the shallow end of the pool at any point during the exercise will 
constitute a failure of this evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second test: Using no swim aids and wearing only a swimsuit, the candidate will stay afloat in a vertical 
position by treading water, drown proofing, bobbing or floating for fifteen (15) minutes, with 
hands out of the water for the last two (2) minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My spouse seems less concerned about the 100 meter swim, and more concerned about the treading water. We did a dry run without looking into techniques or anything and they were able to tread water for about 6 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve since discovered the eggbeater, which we hope might help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t really have regular access to a pool (due to COVID) or body of water, so we&amp;#39;re trying to figure out what kind of an in-the-water schedule they&amp;#39;ll need to train so we can work out some kind of arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything they can do outside of the pool to help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are all well and enjoying swimming if you can or coming up with creative ways to exercise if you can&amp;#39;t currently (I&amp;#39;ve definitely floor swam before)&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"Hi fish people, I've been swimming ""consistently"" since last summer (3 months out due to covid and a torn ACL/meniscus) and I wonder how to track progress without a coach.

I have been watching a ton of Effortless Swimming channel and trying to improve technique on my own, as I cant sign up for coaching/classes due to covid closing group activities in my town.

My only guide is a cheap smartband (xiaomi mi band 4). Right now Im looking at the total time it takes me to do 1k and the curve of speed, checking if I was more or less consistent, top speed, and effort perceived.

My doubt is, when people/beginners say they do 100m in e.g. 2 min, is that sprinting or average? 

Should I dedicate 1 day to track my times at 50m, 100m, 200m, 1k?

,Swimming,"I went swimming today for the third time since my pool reopened. The previous two sessions I went with my sister and we had a lane to ourselves (3 people per lane due to restrictions and I guess everyone avoided our lane!) But today I went alone and had to share a lane with two other swimmers.

At first I was a bit put out because I'm probably one of the fastest that use the pool (very small pool in the middle of no where that mostly caters to older people) and there was already 3 people in the 'faster' lane so I had to go in with two older women who were both swimming breast stroke head up.... but after I got over my initial annoyance, I found it quite eye opening...

I started watching the three ladies in the faster lane and noticed all three were clearly trying to out swim each other... their pool etiquette was awful and they kept trying to stop the others overtaking... it was honestly comical!

It made me really glad that I was in the slower lane pootling along with my two new buddies - I wasn't pressured by my lane friends to go faster than I wanted to and I wasn't pressuring myself to keep up with anyone I wasn't as good as.... and even just pootling along and swimming round my two lane pals, I was still keeping up with the three musketeers in the other lane (and I wasn't splashing half the pool in the process or killing myself :P ) Although I did do a couple sprints just to really stick it to them :P Obviously I was careful to not plow down the two in my lane when I did that :P

&lt;p&gt;But yeh, TL:DR sometimes taking it slow is good :) It stops you looking like a pillock.&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"I know this is a small achievement for this subreddit but it's a big one for me.

A little context. I am 43(F) and super morbidly obese. I started Intermittent fasting in November and have lost almost 100 pounds. Because of COVID my water aerobics classes were ended but the pool quickly reopened. I have always enjoyed swimming a couple of laps after class so I thought I would start swimming instead. This was the end of May.  I also have Chiari Malformation. This causes coordination issues and weakness on my left side. 

At first I just swam an hour. I didn't count laps. I am very, very slow. I haven't had goggles so I was swimming head up, too. I swam 4 days a week. I just really loved it and have gotten really into it. So I treated myself to a Garmin Vivoactive with all the money I am saving on food. I started pushing myself to swim much faster and discovered that I couldn't push beyond 750 meters. I have to stop and catch my breath every 200 meters or so. I am really battling to increase my fitness but it is what it is. 

I decided this week I was going to swim 1km even if it took an hour. Or more! I even asked the facility if I could stay over the hour if the lanes were all open. 

Apparently, it was just my day. I swam my first 750 meters in the fastest time yet and just still felt really solid. I made it to 1 km without even losing pace.

&lt;p&gt;A little context. I am 43(F) and super morbidly obese. I started Intermittent fasting in November and have lost almost 100 pounds. Because of COVID my water aerobics classes were ended but the pool quickly reopened. I have always enjoyed swimming a couple of laps after class so I thought I would start swimming instead. This was the end of May.  I also have Chiari Malformation. This causes coordination issues and weakness on my left side. &lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"This post isn't asking for advice, as much I have just been thinking a lot latley and I really wanted to get some stuff off my chest. 

I’ve had wondering if I would ever reach a point in swimming where I would hit a brick wall from my physical limit and I think I might have just found it, at least just for the 50Y freestyle: ~32 seconds. For reference I’m a 19 year old male who has been swimming competitively for a little shy of two years. When I first got into swimming, I was really slow, but I started making a ton of progress and my 50Y free times at meets dropped from 38 to 32 seconds within just 10 months, which doesn’t sound like an amazing drop but at least I was progressing. That 32 second time I earned last February at the last meet I had before everyone was shut down. Fast forward and practice came back in June and I committed to trying hard each and every every day. Today we were doing sprints off the block and one of the 50 frees I decided to go lights out like I was swimming at a meet to see if I had made any progress since we getting back to practice. My time was 36 seconds and my pool is a meter pool, so using a swim time converter tool that roughly translated to 32 seconds, meaning that I have made absolutely no progress, only including the 3 months I have been able to swim since that last meet, which is extremely worrying. I thought that there was a little hope that I may be able to get better overtime at, but I think I have finally reached my plateau. 

Also it’s important to point out that when I swim the 50Y free, I’m swimming as hard and aggressively as I can with the fastest arm rotations and longest reaching strokes I can muster until my arms are sore. I am in the hardest training group of my team and I somehow able to swim 20 x 100s IM on 2:00 and make every single interval. However can’t break a simple time on a very fast short race and I am not even in the top 55% of swimmers of my age in that event, which is absolutely pathetic. This has made me question how and why I even deserve to be in the place I am in when it comes to swimming, hence the title of this post. 

I honestly don’t want this to seem like I am trying to feel sorry for myself. I most feel apathetic and confused, but I am honestly questioning whether I should have even gotten into swimming in the first place and if I have just been enacting a charade for the past two years, who never should have done this.",t2_6m7gfiq9,False,,0,False,Plateauing and Imposter Syndrome,[],r/Swimming,False,6,tech,0,,,False,t3_idms5i,False,dark,0.8,,public,3,0,{},,63022e8a-6c35-11e9-b01d-0acf30770a48,False,[],,False,False,,{},Technique,False,3,,False,self,1597973306.0,default,[],{},,True,,1597999868.0,text,6,,,text,self.Swimming,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post isn&amp;#39;t asking for advice, as much I have just been thinking a lot latley and I really wanted to get some stuff off my chest. &lt;/p&gt;

\-IM Combo = Split each leg of the IM into stroke/free (i.e. fly-free-back-free-breast-free) or just swim the first 3 strokes of IM (Fly, Back, Breast)

\-Smooth = Faster than easy, slower than moderate

\-Negative Split = Second half should be faster than the first

,Swimming,"Basically, I am confused about the size discrepancies of the same product being offered on various websites. Namely Turbo swimwear. There is a 4.3 inch discrepancy for the sizes. I asked a sales representative and I was told "" The suit is made differently and sized differently in other countries."" Is this true? 

I have been to a variety of websites that sell turbo swimsuits. (swimoutlet and kap7) And the measurements for the same suit differ on turboswim from the other sites.

Namely Turbo swimwear. There is a 4.3 inch discrepancy for the sizes. I asked a sales representative and I was told &amp;quot; The suit is made differently and sized differently in other countries.&amp;quot; Is this true? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been to a variety of websites that sell turbo swimsuits. (swimoutlet and kap7) And the measurements for the same suit differ on turboswim from the other sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://turboswim.com/themes/turbo/assets/img/tallas/310_en.jpg""&gt;https://turboswim.com/themes/turbo/assets/img/tallas/310_en.jpg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sizing guide on turboswim for 4XL. Chest 106, Waist  86, Hip 106 , Torso 81 in centimetres converts to roughly  41.7, 33.8, 41.7, 31.8 in inches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://www.swimoutlet.com/size-charts/turbo/turbo-women-s-swimwear-sizechart_s929/""&gt;https://www.swimoutlet.com/size-charts/turbo/turbo-women-s-swimwear-sizechart_s929/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sizing guide on swimoutlet for 4XL. Chest and Hip 46+ inches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://store-7kx4v.mybigcommerce.com/size-guide/""&gt;https://store-7kx4v.mybigcommerce.com/size-guide/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sizing guide on Kap7 for 4XL. Chest and Hip 46 inches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://store.waterpoloshop.com/pages/turbo-size-chart""&gt;https://store.waterpoloshop.com/pages/turbo-size-chart&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sizing guide on waterpoloshop agrees with turboswim (uses metric units)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"Hi Y'all,

To combat the vast amount of ""COVID fluff"" I've added to my midsection, I hopped into a pool about 6 weeks ago and started swimming 4-5 days/week. I've been lap swimming on and off over the last couple years or so, but I've never been a competitive swimmer nor swam laps prior.

I've been swimming about 1600m per workout with various strokes. I break it up into 8 sets, and perform: Freestyle (50m), Breaststroke (50m), Sidestroke (50m), Freestyle (50m) per set.. When I first started, my time was about an hour for that distance. Now it's sub 40min with minimal breaks, and I've lost 7lbs so far! Suck it COVID fluff.

The problem is now I'm very comfortable in the pool and need more challenging workouts...and I have absolutely no friggin' idea what I'm doing.

My goal is to continue to do my 1600m distance routine in Freestyle - because I find that to be a challenging and gassing stroke for me. For the time being to increase my conditioning, I've been adding 400m of 25m sprints at the end of the 1600m.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's also worth mentioning that I also have been lifting weights out of the pool

&amp;#x200B;

What else can I do to increase my conditioning, speed, and endurance in the pool? Can someone help me design a workout to achieve these goals?

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm 27 and I don't feel fit, I have a long term relationship and a office job and been going to the gym on and off for years.

As I swam for so long, did competition as well and am experienced, I want to get back to swimming again.

Is there anyone else in this sub who wants to get started again but needs a bit more incentive to do it. If so, does anyone wants to join in as like a accountability partner group. Could be on reddit chat or whatsapp or some other group chat. Perhaps we can stimulate each other to do so.

If this is the case, please let me know we can get something going.

Since primary school I've been able to perform a (terrible) version of the front crawl.

I've never really swam since (36) - apart from playing around on holiday and recently when taking my young son. I'm a fairly fit guy but after 2-3 lengths I am really tired. While there is much I can improve in terms of overall technique I think a major issue is breathing (swallowing water, panic etc). 

Our local pool has re opened today and I was considering lessons but these aren't yet available (covid). I was wondering what I could practice on my own in terms of breathing to build confidence?

I use a swim tether, with a snorkel and a mask, and saw my stats for the week.

&lt;p&gt;Also, what calorie calculator do you think is most accurate? I tried several, but results are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"Hi guys! So recently I’ve started swimming as I’ve put on quite some weight in the past year or so. I used to have swimming lessons when I was younger, but I haven’t swam properly for years up until recently. 

I have multiple questions and I’m not very good at writing essays so you’ll have to bare with me. 

Whenever I swim I mainly do breaststroke, this is because I have difficulty breathing when doing the front crawl. The problem is, when doing the breaststroke I tend to strain my neck and I feel like the more I do it, the worse it will get. I feel like I have a pretty good technique for breathing already but I would like to know if you would recommend using breaststroke for long distances daily (my gym only has 45minute sessions atm and is a 25m pool). 

Whenever I have tried to do the front crawl I can barely make it halfway of the 25m pool. I get exhausted and I struggle with breathing and end up breathing in water. The pool is also quite small and busy so I get embarrassed to practice after ive breathed in water and I also feel like I’m splashing everywhere like crazy too. 

What is the best stroke to do long distances and lose weight?  Bare in mind that my sessions are only 45 minutes and I don’t stop swimming once I get in, until the whistle blows and I have to get out. 

I really enjoy swimming as I seem to forget about everything once I’m in the pool. I’m really excited that I’ve found something I really love doing and it also helps me lose weight, as I’m struggling with that at the minute. With going daily I just want to find the right stroke/technique where I don’t end up injuring myself and have to miss a lot of time out.

,Swimming,"This may be an odd question, but these are odd times...

As a kid, I did several blocks of swim lessons at our local YMCA and actually got pretty good. I grew up on the low side of the SES spectrum, so we could never afford for me to do swim clubs or teams, and I went to a tiny school with no swim team. But I always loved to swim. As an adult, I am still confident in the general execution of breaststroke, backstroke, and freestyle, and understand the basic mechanics of butterfly but am not good at the execution at all. 

My kids love to swim, and I got us a membership to an indoor pool so they can keep at it as it starts getting cooler outside. They have a kids section, and then lap lanes. I've remembered just how much I love swimming, and really want to start doing fitness swimming. 

So my question is this. Do you have any resources you would recommend for fitness swim drills and technique improvement aimed towards adults? I know my form needs work. I don't have any ambitions of turning into some competitive triathlon athlete. I just want to be doing what I am doing right, you know?

I am a 31M, average fitness and started freestyle earlier this year. My condo has a 30m pool and I set goal for myself at the beginning of the year to be able to swim 10 rounds without break. At the beginning I was barely able to do 1 without panting for breath.

And today....I did 20 laps !!! Obviously my pace and techniques are still terrible but I'm feeling ecstatic to have come so far !!! Some of the advice I took from this sub helps me a ton :

\- I reached and extended more with each stroke.

\- I rotated my hip instead of shoulder to breath.

\- I used to overkick a lot, this time I was more mindful of my kicking and tried to kick with a more even pace.

\- I took more time to warm up.

I also realized  around 6-8 laps are the most difficult part, stamina wise. After that it just somehow became very easy. 

So what would you guys suggest for  the next steps to train ?  Do I train for more speed or more distance ? What are the realistic goals for someone my age ?

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to incorpore a chest/triceps/delt routine for fly and in this case do I need to train the whole chest or just for example the upper chest ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I need to have a leg routine aswell since I&amp;#39;m already a good kicker especially in fly already ?&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"Hey everyone,

I swam in high school(graduated HS 6 years ago) and recently graduated college and want to get back into swimming. I have been training on my own for a bit recently to get back into swimming, but hope to find a masters club, or join a college swim club if I decide to go back to school. In high school, my best event was the 100 yard fly and I went a 1:02.9 in yards. This was my senior year of high school(I am a male), and I am now 24 years old. My goal time would be to go a 56, or even faster with more practice. Would this be possible given my situation? I have barely practiced at all in those 6 years, but have found I am gradually getting back into shape with recently getting back into swimming. I weigh a bit more than I did in high school, but am currently working on losing weight and swimming has really been helping.

My two main questions:

\-How long would it take me to get back to where I was?

\-How long would it take me to go a 56 100 fly, if that is even possible for me at this point or am I out of my mind?

I know everyone's situation is different and that everyone is different when it comes to swimming in general, but I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions based on the information I gave.

,Swimming,"Hi,

I’ve been swimming regularly for about a month now and can do 2km in around 55mins, at which point I don’t have much left in the tank.. I’ve been swimming 2km for a few weeks now and struggling to increase distance, so wondering how to increase my distance up to the 3-4km mark?

Ideally I’d like to join my local masters squad who I’m told swim 3-4km at 2min/100m pace

I would like to refine and improve my technique. I’m happy to do drills and what not but I don’t know what to do as I just go to my local pool and swim! I probably swam 25 years or so when I was a kid so I’ve forgotten everything and I also imagine methods and techniques have developed a lot since then.

I was able to get someone film me today and I’d love any feedback, tips or suggestions on what I can do to develop and refine my technique. 

My 100m lap times were between 1:46-1:48, but I seem to need a long rest interval between as my recovery is quite poor despite swimming 3-4x a week for the past month or so. Ideally I’d love to be able to do sub 2min/100m with 10-15secs rest for 3-4km, but I’m not sure if this is realistic or not.

If you can include links or videos of drills for me to do and suggest how I plan my training to improve so that I can join my local masters squad that would be greatly appreciated!

Notes for this set:

\-IMO = Individual Medley Order (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle)

\-The second 4x25 sprint should be faster than the first group of 4x25 sprint

\-Katie Ladecky Challenge = [https://youtu.be/1GhTMrCzzhY](https://youtu.be/1GhTMrCzzhY) I would be surprised if your pool allowed you to use any liquid other than water for this, but it can still be done. Fill a red solo cup half to 3/4 full and balance the cup on your head as you swim across the pool. I strongly advise the use of a snorkel and taking it slow. If you don't have a snorkel, like anyone on our team this morning, just remove the cup from your head to breathe then put it back.

\-The 4x50s following the Katie Ladecky challenge is a continuation of the focus you needed for that but with out the cup balancing act and a full 50 distance.

Let me state, first of all, I do not care how fast or far I go. 

I have been using just heart rate to go on, so far. Easily going into zone 3 and 4. I started with just treading water ( floor and walls are lava) I’m starting to incorporate breast stroke (only strong I’m comfortable with)

Notes for this set:

\-Double Pullouts = After pushing off the wall, do 2 pull out strokes before breaking into a normal breast stroke

\-IMO = Individual Medley Order (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle)

\-Fly Rules = Don't breathe on your first stroke after pushing off the wall. As you continue, breathe every other stroke. Once you pass the flags coming into the wall, no more breaths until you reach the wall.

\-Sprint the Black = Sprint in the solid colored section of your pools lane lines then a moderate speed outside of that. Our pools lane lines are red/black with black being the 5m lead in color to the wall, hence fast in the black.

\-Build = Start slow then get faster within the given distance

\-Strong = Faster than moderate, but slower than fast

Notes for this set:

\-IMO = Individual Medley Order (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle)

\-For clarification because our team questioned it this morning. For the 4x100 the entire distance should be swam with the same stroke (#1 100 Fly, #2 100 Back, #3 100 Breast, #4 100 Free). After you swim 75 of the 100, rest at the wall for 10 seconds, then swim the last 25 of the 100 at a faster pace than you swam the first 75. The 4x75's follow the same general pattern.

\-Negative Split = Second half should be faster than the first

\-Smooth = Faster than easy, slower than moderate

&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to my google drive with previous workouts- &lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tHrMzBZWcVHQcs03vZX8rNQ73mdyR1j7?usp=sharing""&gt;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tHrMzBZWcVHQcs03vZX8rNQ73mdyR1j7?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt; *Tuesday workouts can be found in the Monday folder &amp;amp; Thursday&amp;#39;s in the Wednesday folder*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in joining a masters swim club, here is a link to help you find a local club near you. &lt;a href=""https://www.usms.org/clubs""&gt;https://www.usms.org/clubs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes for this set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-IMO = Individual Medley Order (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-For clarification because our team questioned it this morning. For the 4x100 the entire distance should be swam with the same stroke (#1 100 Fly, #2 100 Back, #3 100 Breast, #4 100 Free). After you swim 75 of the 100, rest at the wall for 10 seconds, then swim the last 25 of the 100 at a faster pace than you swam the first 75. The 4x75&amp;#39;s follow the same general pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Negative Split = Second half should be faster than the first&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Smooth = Faster than easy, slower than moderate&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"Hello! A few weeks ago I decided to start working towards swimming a mile freestyle without stopping for rest or changing strokes. When I started working towards this goal I couldn’t do more than about 400 meters before I needed to switch to breaststroke or take a rest. Last night I did 2.5k freestyle without stopping! I could have gone farther but my shoulders were very fatigued and I didn’t want to overdo it. 

I’m a nearly 44 yr old male. I’ve always loved to swim to the point that I earned a bronze cross and lifeguard certification as a teenager, but I never trained seriously beyond that, or did any kind of competing. I’ve never had a coach and I have no idea what to do next as a swimmer. I’d like to get faster and use swimming as a major part of my fitness routine, and possibly do some masters races, or aqua bike races, in the future. 

My 2.5k was slow - took me around 70 minutes, in a short course pool. I did it in board shorts swim trunks which I know made the swimming slower and harder (I’ll plan on getting some jammers even though I’m fat, if I keep swimming seriously), and I don’t know how to do a flip turn or proper dolphin kick. I’m also quite certain that my technique could be improved. I know freestyle, breaststroke, and backstroke. I don’t know butterfly. 

So what’s next for me? I’d love some advice and guidance on how I can progress as a swimmer for exercise, recreation and possibly competition. I’m finding just doing laps kind of boring but I don’t know how to program workouts. Is there any other equipment I should get, other than a better suit? I have an ok pair of goggles and that’s it.

,Swimming,"Background: I was scared to death of the water as a kid. My parents tried to get me into swimming lessons and I fought tooth and nail to avoid getting in the water. After a couple rounds of failed lessons at the local YMCA, they quit trying. After I graduated high school (2005), I took one round of Red Cross Level 2 lessons at the community pool, where I was more than twice the age of anyone else in my class. I learned basic float positions and very basic front/back strokes and kicking here, but failed the level because I floated too low in the water. I didn't go back, chiefly because I felt out of place being the only adult in a class of 6-to-8-year-olds, and they didn't offer any adult-only groups.

A few years later in my early 20s (around 2008-2010), I tried small group (4-5 people) adult lessons at the same YMCA from my childhood. I was able to refresh my skills from the community pool and build on them a little, but I still was floating too low. I could not raise my face high enough to rotary breathe, and could not do backstroke with my face out of the water. Immediately after a 7-week session of the group classes, I arranged private instruction through the YMCA. I worked with a private instructor through six sessions with zero progress. I could not even stay high enough in the water to tread water with my face above the surface. The private instructor and I concluded that my body was probably too dense to float normally, and I resigned myself to hoping I would lose some bone density as I got older.

In January 2019 (now age 32), I decided to try again with group adult lessons at the YMCA. This did not work, as the lessons were divided into beginner and intermediate, and I don't have the skills to qualify as intermediate, but the beginner lessons assumed everyone was a raw beginner with zero experience. Every lesson (usually with a different instructor every week) was a repeat of the previous, from ""get used to putting your face in the water"" (I made my peace with that as a teenager) to the bare basic skills repeated every time. I quit after three months with zero progress. I didn't like several of the instructors that cycled through my class (a couple were downright rude), so I didn't bother asking about private lessons, and canceled my membership shortly thereafter.

This spring I was planning to hunt for other, non-YMCA options for private instruction over the summer, but obviously COVID-19 put a halt to that. So now I'm looking ahead to next summer.

Here's where I currently stand: I'm 33 years old, 34 by next summer when I actually hope to get into private lessons. I can manage a basic front crawl stroke and kicking (not very powerful or well coordinated, but enough to move through the water), and a basic backstroke, but cannot maintain either for more than 15-20 seconds without flotation support or stopping to stand up due to my inability to breathe while swimming, which stems from floating too low. I also cannot tread water, as I just sink below the surface. As of the last round of lessons, I can swim (slow) laps with a life vest to keep me afloat, but without a flotation device, I have to stay in the shallow end. When I try to float on my back, no matter how much I try to follow instructors' advice on proper body position, my legs slowly sink.

I'm not trying to be a powerful swimmer to do triathlons or swim laps for an hour for fitness. I just want to have the basic skills needed to jump off the high dive without drowning or panicking so that I don't have to turn down an invitation to a pool party.

So here are my two questions:

1. Is there something else I could be overlooking (other than body density) that could be causing my persistent flotation issues? The issues have persisted even when instructors have attempted to physically correct my body position. I'll take any suggestions, but I don't currently have access to a pool to try them out. (That might change in a few weeks depending on whether my university rec center has the pool open when classes resume later this month; the director has told me it might be.)
2. What resources are out there to help find private instructors? Is there a good directory of some kind where I can see who's in my area? Or where do I start asking? I explicitly do not want to go back to the YMCA; I'm through and done with them. But I don't know of any resource for private and/or adult lessons other than the Y. If it helps, I'm in western Greene County, Ohio (Beavercreek/Fairborn area) but willing to drive as much as an hour if I have to. I'm willing to spend a reasonable amount of money ($200-$300 range, maybe a bit more if absolutely necessary), but I can't break the bank.",t2_337tn37i,False,,0,False,"Been trying off and on to learn how to swim, at my wit's end.

,Swimming,"Learned to swim a few months ago pre-covid, and didn't really get to start practicing actively until about six weeks ago when pools opened again. I've been doing laps but I have found that I am out of breath really quickly. 

I'm not out of shape, I have about ten pounds I could lose, but I know weight doesn't really have a factor into being able to swim.

I have pretty bad asthma, which is triggered mostly by cardio, and I've noticed my lung capacity is shit (even outside of water lol). I have been breathing on every other stroke because of this, but I still am having to stop like every two laps before I am able to start again. I am basically out of breath before my legs get tired, so what I've been doing is trying to slowly go longer without ""breathing breaks"". 

Example:
-Swim two laps, take a minute or two to catch my breath, swim another set of two laps, repeat a few times
- Step outside the pool to just tan/recover (about 20-30min)
- After recovering to ensure that I won't have an asthma attack, swim two laps again, take a minute or two to recover, etc. 

Is this normal with moderate to severe asthma? Does it get better? I know most beginners have to build up their stamina, but this feels a little different with the breathing difficulty.

,Swimming,"Hi everyone!

My parents just had a new pool fitted, and it’s a whopping 8.5m in length and probably 4m wide. The past few days I’ve been swimming in it, but my times are so slow because of the amount of time it takes to turn around at either end. For freestyle, I’m averaging maybe 7 strokes before I hit the side. I’m also experiencing a lot more neck pain from the constant reaching up to grab the sides. 

I am used to swimming in a 25m pool, but here where I live public pools aren’t open yet and it’s kinda nice to swim at home. 

The past few days I’ve swum 500m and it’s taken me around 4minutes per hundred metres. Ideally I’d like to swim further, maybe 800-1000m but it seems tricky in such a small space. 

Does anyone have any experience or advice swimming in a tiny pool like this, or can give any tips on how to reduce neck pain and fatigue from constantly stopping and turning round? (Note, did try tumble turning but it cut the number of strokes per length down significantly).

,Swimming,"Since my local pool opened again, I have been suffering from a few health effects that I feel are related to chlorine levels in the pool. My feeling is they have bumped up the levels due to covid, and thus my reaction.

Symptoms as follows...
Runny nose, sneezing, loss of smell for a day or so after swimming. These effects I can deal with, but the worst one, at night as I go to sleep. I will be almost asleep then suddenly I will jolt awake with the feeling that I have stopped breathing and have no oxygen. 
After 4 days of swimming and some long hard sessions 2 weeks ago this all got quite bad. I had last week off and all the symptoms have gone. I did a 3.5km open water swim yesterday and no side effects at all, except for feeling great!

I have read studies about asthma being induced by pool chlorine, but if anyone can shed any light about this subject, and have some personal experience I’d love to hear it, especially if it involves a solution to swim and avoid these side effects.

,Swimming,"Hi folks,

I've been swimming for about and year now. I did 15 swimming lessons (an hour each) with a private coach at the swimming pool I swim in. 

I really focus on perfecting my form rather than speed and distance. So I do a lot of drills my coach told me to do. 

I swim every day. Some days I swim pretty smoothly and effortlessly, and I get the feeling of achievement. 

But every now and then I somehow forget how to swim, the form feel weird, just not feeling right, and I got disappointed at myself. 

I feel that it's kind of a mental issue. Since my tiring and boring 9-5 job, swimming time after work is the happiest time through out the day. And I might be taking it too seriously, wanting to get the feeling of achievement since I can't get it from my work.

It's kinda weird to ask, but has anyone gotten the same feeling of not swimming as smooth as other days every now and then.

Thankfully a friend who is an avid swimmer swam out with a tube and helped me back. I couldn’t believe how fast my thighs cramped. Swimming is harder than I thought. I’d like to conquer the buoy without cramping and prove I can do it someday.&lt;/p&gt;

The university I attended didn't really have too much of an opportunity to keep being on a team, and their official swim team is D1 and one of the fastest teams in the US, so swimming in college was absolutely out of the question.

A little background about me: I am a 24 year old male, recently graduated college and have stopped swimming and exercise almost entirely since graduating high school in 2014. I have probably swam only 10 times since then. Over the past few weeks, I have been using my backyard pool almost everyday to get back into shape(and have been sprinting fast to get back into shape quickly), and normally would have gone to the 25 yard community pool but obviously have not been able to due to covid. I am currently about 20 pounds more than I was in high school, but at one point was extremely out of shape being about 70 pounds more than I was in high school, so I have made good progress in losing weight. In fact, I started swimming again with the initial intention of losing weight, but have realized how much I missed swimming competitively in the process.

When I was swimming competitively, butterfly was my best stroke and my time was a 1:02 for the 100 yard fly. Now, I know this isn't super fast at all for a male which is another incentive for wanting to get back into swimming. I have always wanted to go faster than this just for personal accomplishment. I would ideally want to go under a minute, and preferably around a 56-57. I know this isn't going to get me some sort of scholarship or national recognition, but I have just wanted to get back into this for personal enjoyment and accomplishment. Be honest: How crazy am I for wanting this time as a 24 year old who took a 6 year break? I had the reasoning that I shouldn't have trouble dropping time since my time wasn't too fast to begin with, but of course I am older and out of shape.

To get back into swimming, I am planning on doing masters, and had a few questions about this.

\-How would the experience be in practices and meets compared to high school and age group club swimming?

\-Since masters swimming is a thing, why do most people who graduate high school that aren't swimming in college stop swimming entirely instead of doing masters?

\-How enjoyable and exciting is masters compared to high school swimming, and is it motivational?

Another big reason for wanting to get back into swimming was that I had no experience before high school. Since I only did it for a short time, my swim life felt like it was over before it even started, and felt really cut short.

,Swimming,"With it being the weekend many swimmers would be gathering around a screen to watch their hero's shoot for the podium in Tokyo -- the first swimming final would have been tonight IIRC -- I decided to sit down with my daughter and watch ""The Last Gold"", the story of the US women's 1976 face off against East Germany.   It's a really timely movie for the current generation of rising swimmers to watch in my opinion, because many of the film's themes --  how much bias the media can inject against someone when they think it's going to sell papers, how young / female athletes are not always in a position to stand up for themselves, and what it means to triumph over adversity -- are even more present in our modern US society than they were 40 years ago.    (And, from a strictly American perspective, I think it can be a good entry point into a discussion of how attitudes of American exceptionalism can be powerful armor, not just always an exposed wound for historical revisionists to poke and prod). 

Anyway, the film is on Vimeo here: [https://vimeo.com/155310924](https://vimeo.com/155310924) (there is an access code floating around online for US Swimming members), and there are some other streaming services offering it too if you don't have access to that link.    For all the reasons above, I think that any swimmer, male or female , who is sitting at home tonight in disappointment, even just because they were looking forward to seeing their sport make it's once-an-Olympiad rise to national consciousness, will gain valuable perspective on how there have been many curve-balls that changed record books, affected careers, and even personal lives of athletes over the years.

,Swimming,"Back in February I bought of a pair of the Cobra ultra swipe goggles to use at an upcoming swim meet, since I lost my pair of Speedo FastSkin goggles. However because of COVID-19, all meets were cancelled, pools were closed, and I was not able to swim for months. The pair of goggles I had been using at practice were a cheap mirrored pair, but they had started to become really foggy and when I finally did get back to swimming, I decided to try using Cobra goggles in the pool for the first time and with a better FOV and lower profile, it felt amazing and far less clausterphobic to my face.

Just wanted to see if that’s a good price or if anyone knows of sales that occur where I may find them cheaper.

I'm not in my youth, late 20's, and never really did much work in the lap pool during my youth.

I mostly work on the front crawl during my workouts but also occasionally throw in some breaststroke to add variation to my workouts. A typical session is a 100m freestyle sprint, followed by a relaxed 200m or 400m freestyle followed by a 50m breaststroke, finishing off with 1 or 2 100m freestyle lengths. I use unilateral breathing for half of the pool then switch to unilateral breathing on the other side for the rest of the pool, I also use bilateral breathing during my 200m or 400m freestyle.

I never had any formal swim coaching and perhaps this would help my technique greatly. I'm all self-taught. I don't think I'll ever be competitive level given my age, but I would like to improve my technique and in tandem my times. Any advice on choosing a good coach would be appreciated.

Today I got a membership to a pool so I can start swimming to get in better shape. I'm not super athletic but I think swimming every other day will be a great way to start. I will get the pool to myself for an hour every other day (due to the 'rona). I had swim lessons as a kid but I barely remember them. I can float, tread water, and swim about 60-100 feet pretty well. I'm sure its not graceful looking but I can get the job done. What do you recommend for a starting training routine? Should I just swim laps? How often do I take breaks? Is it OK if I just go out and try my best at things like the backstroke, etc without any real technique or is that risky somehow?

,Swimming,"I don’t know if it was actually depression but it was the most intense feelings of sadness that I have ever felt in my life.

I’m a competitive swimmer who used to swim with a “fun” team. Yes, training would be difficult at times, but we’re also have fun games or relays at least once a week.

For personal reasons, I had to switch teams late last year. This new team had more difficult workouts, with sets I could barely keep up with. We never had games. We only had relays on someone’s birthday, but since there were usually only 20 of us training at a time, that means we’d have about 20 relays a year.

It was so hard and I have started to dread training, but I still pushed through because it’s what I thought I needed to get better. However, when the national meet came up, I was experiencing the worst bouts of anxiety I’ve ever felt. I had terrible insomnia for the first time in my life. I added time and I felt so bad.

Since quarantine started, I’ve never felt that sad again. My mental health has been doing pretty good now. Since I’m going to college now, I’m not going to train with that same team again, and I feel relieved. My college team seems to be more fun and have sets that are a bit easier.

,Swimming,"Hey all, long time swimmer that took a really long break and getting back into a regular routine here. 

I'd say the past 4-6 years I've had on and off shoulder discomfort/pain that I've kind of attributed to a long term usage that just kinda blew them out and had accepted that I wouldn't have very good mobility the rest of my life. 

I kept swimming maybe 1-3 times a week just to keep some fitness and found that backstroke was difficult to even get a full stroke in and free style would result in some discomfort fairly regularly. 

Fast forward to my current situation- I've started swimming regularly 5 days a week again with some increased effort and at the start I had really crunchy(?) shoulders that I could hear when swimming freestyle or breaststroke especially. 
But now- it's nearly all stopped and my mobility has dramatically increased. I'm able to lift my arm directly up and it's not painful or crunchy!! I've only had this routine for probably 3 weeks, so hasn't been that long.

,Swimming,"Hiya folks,

I took swimming classes in the summer of 2018 to get acquinted with it again since I hadnt swam since childhood.

Once I had those classes I started to swim weekly, building up to 45 minutes of froglegs (dont know english name for it)/basic swim and then after having reached that for a month, I decided to integrate borstcrawl into it. 

I now have reached the point I can do 25m of borstcrawl but on the way back I simply run out of air or feel like I'm bursting. Twice I had that I exhaled through my nose while head was in water.

I try to exhale on the third stroke using the corner of my mouth so I wont get all that in my nose but I still run out of breath after 35-40meters. 

Any tips on how to improve my breathing, exhale and inhale to improve it? 

My aim now is to complete the there-and-back 50m before going for 5 minutes, 10minutes, 15minutes of borstcrawl.

so i swam a lot when i was in middle school, never competitive but i wasn't bad. im currently overweight, but until quarantine i was doing weight training and was a beginner at it. (i know. very unlucky)

now im staying with my family and there's a pool, so i've been swimming almost daily for 2 weeks, but mostly just having fun splashing, stuff like that. today i found out about r/swimming and decided to try this out for real. so i tried swimming for 1 km, probably at a slow pace i think, it took something like 45 mins. i feel fine, i had to get out because i had to get dinner :&gt; i have 2ish months till im off to uni again, and want to make the best of it in terms of training.

since i have absolutely no idea how to continue, im all for opinions: should i train for speed or for length? what would be the best next step or goal?

Because this is Masters, feel free to add/subtract/or modify in anyway you see fit.

Notes for this set:

\-Stroke Count Golf = Count the number of strokes it takes to swim the given distance, add the time it takes to swim the given distance, the result is your golf score. Try and lower your score each time till you complete the set. (40 Stokes + 55 sec = 95 golf score)

\-Build = Start slow then get faster within the given distance

\-Start Off Blocks = If your facility does not have starting blocks, or does not allow their use without a coach present, just do fast starts from in the water

Bit the problem is that whenever I bring up the topic of workouts or swimming I am meet with threats of being thrown out of the house and abandoned. How do I deal with this?&lt;/p&gt;

Choose the column that works best for you and if you find that you are consistently getting more rest than column 5, move up a level. Because this is Masters, feel free to add/subtract/or modify in anyway you see fit. 

Here is a link to my google drive with previous workouts - [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tHrMzBZWcVHQcs03vZX8rNQ73mdyR1j7?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tHrMzBZWcVHQcs03vZX8rNQ73mdyR1j7?usp=sharing)

Notes for this set:

\-DPS (Distance Per Stroke) = Maximize the distance traveled for each stroke while minimizing the total number of strokes to complete the set

\-Build = Start slow then get faster within the given distance

\-Sprint the Black = Sprint swim in the solid colored section of your pools lane lines then moderate/easy outside of that. Our pools lane lines are red/black with black being the 5m lead in color to the wall, hence sprint the black.

,Swimming,"Hey guys, I would love to get some feedback on my freestyle stroke. I'm a recreational swimmer trying to improve. The background is:

* 27y, 190cm, 70kg - tall and skinny.
* Swimming roughly 12 kilometers a week.
* Swimming for one year, quite strong rock climber before.
* My goal is to swim relaxed freestyle, ideally 1000m in 15 minutes, i.e. @ 1:30 pace.
* Definitely wan't to have a long stroke with 6 beat kick that is present just to provide better position in the water (not really to propel that much). It seems that 2 beat kick does not really work with my zero buoyancy.
* *Points that I see to improve:* Catch phase, does my elbow or whole arm drop? Am I lifting the head too much? Do I swing too much?
* *Points that I'm proud of:* Recovery phase, feels relaxed, looks quite good IMO; flexibility of ankles, the leg kick looks OK to me, although I have problem to kick 100m straight with a kickboard alone. 

I provide three videos of my stroke:

1. Underwater view of freestyle, roughly @ 1:40 pace. I'm able to swim over 200m like that: [https://youtu.be/ZjZtuMUQVeE](https://youtu.be/ZjZtuMUQVeE)
2. Faster freesyle @ 1:30 pace, I'm able to swim roughly 200m like that (don't bother with the dolphin kick, didn't still quite get it back after covid break): [https://youtu.be/d\_9WsRrJGWo](https://youtu.be/d_9WsRrJGWo)
3. Pretty much flat-out @ 1:10 pace, I get tired even before 100m mark: [https://youtu.be/Vt7OP0bHzNk](https://youtu.be/Vt7OP0bHzNk)

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Points that I&amp;#39;m proud of:&lt;/em&gt; Recovery phase, feels relaxed, looks quite good IMO; flexibility of ankles, the leg kick looks OK to me, although I have problem to kick 100m straight with a kickboard alone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I provide three videos of my stroke:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underwater view of freestyle, roughly @ 1:40 pace. I&amp;#39;m able to swim over 200m like that: &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/ZjZtuMUQVeE""&gt;https://youtu.be/ZjZtuMUQVeE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster freesyle @ 1:30 pace, I&amp;#39;m able to swim roughly 200m like that (don&amp;#39;t bother with the dolphin kick, didn&amp;#39;t still quite get it back after covid break): &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/d_9WsRrJGWo""&gt;https://youtu.be/d_9WsRrJGWo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty much flat-out @ 1:10 pace, I get tired even before 100m mark: &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/Vt7OP0bHzNk""&gt;https://youtu.be/Vt7OP0bHzNk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like you to answer if I&amp;#39;m on a good way to mature freestyle stroke, and what points should I concentrate on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for any constructive answer!&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"I knew I am a bit biased towards hydro foils and looked into all kinds of swimming advice. But recently I swam back-stroke without other swimmers near me.

And the key to this is to get rid of air bubbles (which foil every hydrofoil), and then just to be precise. Aeroplanes work because their tail points them very precisely into the air stream. It is just so hard to get this pointing right when smashing into the water. I hate to think in Reynolds-Numbers, but cannot ignore the fact that as I grew and when I train more muscles =&gt; both increase this number, I get a better grip. Anyway, I should train more flexibility, but on back-stroke by hand gets pulled down into the water by the grip. This gives an indirekt boost.

I experienced a similar effect on my feet over the small toes on breast stroke (my worst stroke). I started to extend the stream over my feet by rotating them like propellers at the end of the leg stroke. Hands rotate at the beginning.

With butterfly I have the problem that my hands collide or I go asymmetric and break official swimming rules? For the dolphin kick I think I got some effective streaming going on over my big toes. Do I have to point them inwards? Is there a way to get fresh water to my feet (which wasn't disturbed by my body?)

,Swimming,"Hi all! I’m an adult beginner trying to improve my freestyle so that I can increase my comfort actually swimming and could use some help. (I learned to swim as a kid but always had a fear of water, so I never got much better than a backstroke. I took some beginner lessons in the last few years and feel totally fine on the wall, with a kickboard, etc, but still don’t feel 100% comfortable when putting it all together in the open water.) 

I’ve definitely lost some of my fear now that I know I can tread, and since my backstroke is pretty decent,  but I’m still having issues with mastering the freestyle and losing my fear. 

My problems are mainly: 

1) I am a little unused to/scared of putting my face in the water while actually swimming - I know how to breathe and put my face in just fine when practicing on the wall, but just when i put it all together with going through the strokes, as well as opening eyes under water, my brain panics and it gets a little messy and flaily and I stand up. (I hate that my brain does this bc I’m not scared of drowning at all in 5 foot water! I think it’s the water splashing in my face that throws me off?)

2) I’m not great at keeping hips and legs from sinking a little so i feel exhausted in my arms and nothing in my body and legs after I do a few laps 

Would a kickboard be the right tool to help? And if so, a tombstone shaped one or something like the Finis Alignment Board? I don’t think my stroke + arm + face positioning mechanics are good enough yet for a pool buoy....

I’m definitely wearing my goggles on my next swim, but would love any advice!!",t2_15ouvl,False,,0,False,Freestyle Help for a beginner,[],r/Swimming,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_hoyfvf,False,dark,0.86,,public,9,0,{},,63022e8a-6c35-11e9-b01d-0acf30770a48,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,,1594448176.0,text,6,,,text,self.Swimming,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all!

My first week I struggled to complete 200m in one go. My breathing technique was so bad and I panicked constantly while swimming. I also felt like vomiting during the session due to swallowing copious amounts of water. 

Second week, got progressively better - started doing 4 x 500m sets 4 times a week so around 8km for that week.

Third(current) week - Swam 5 x 500m Monday, 1 x 1000m + 3 x 500m on Tues and Thurs and just did 2500m straight without stopping today (Friday) !

That totals 10km for this week.

Super stoked with the progress so far, I'm thinking about maintaining 10km a week and then start adding in longer distance swims on the weekends. Then around October, start progressively increasing the distance per week. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

Huge shoutout to you guys, I've been patrolling the subreddit and learning a lot so I owe you guys one for that.

I always wondered why I was so bad at swimming, since I'd say I'm pretty good at land sports, competing in high level for volleyball.

This lesson was simply amazing, I went from not being able to swim at all, to being able to swim backwards with arm movement.

All these pointers helped me a lot. Since I caught on pretty quickly with everything the instructor also started teaching some arm movements to me the backwards swimming movements with my arms.

,Swimming,"I'm kind of new to swimming and unfortunately I can't get lessons or get in a pool.  All I have is youtube videos and a lake. 

So I just made an interesting discovery today after trying out a pull buoy today.  Instead of it lifting my legs up so I don't have to kick to keep my legs up my legs sink really badly as soon as I start to stroke.  after like 10 strokes I'm literally standing vertical in the water despite having a pull buoy between thighs.

This tells me something that should be kind of obvious I guess.  The crawl stroke creates a strong rotating force rotating my body in the opposite direction that my arms are ""windmilling"".  Previously I just thought my legs sank because they were denser than water.  Now I realize the arm stroke must be part of it.  Like duh, obviously it must.  If you're creating a force that doesn't go through the center of inertia it will create a moment around your center.  This moment is lifting the head up and bringing the legs down.

I'm trying to correctly catch the water.  I try to bend my elbow and try to pull water horizontally past me rather than down or up.  But still, I'm rotating badly.

Trying to google my situation is not helpful.  Asking about what ""legs sinking when using pull buoy"" just gives me hits about simply using a pull buoy.

I have no clue on how I should do it. How many &amp;#39;laps&amp;#39; I should do and what exercises. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I have volleyball practices, monday, Tuesday, and thursday, monday for 2 hours, Tuesday and Thursday for 4 hours, is it ok for me just to go wednesdays and fridays? Should I include the weekend? How many times should I go considering my current schedule?&lt;/p&gt;

Notes for this set: (I will do my best to describe the drills we did today, but it might be better to try and find a video to watch rather than simply going by the description)

\-Body Dolphin = Push off the wall with your arms straight out in front. Press your chest down and up to progress across the lane. Try not to actively kick, instead allow the undulation your body creates to form the kick that propels you down the lane. (I would recommend fins if you have them)

\-Body Dolphin w/ Scull = Same form as body dolphin but when you bring your chest back up from pressing down allow your arms to go out forming a Y like you were dancing the YMCA (except with your palms facing down, not in). When you press your chest down again bring your hands back to straight in front.

\-Catch &amp; Shoot = Just like body dolphin w/ scull, but on the 3rd Y catch and pull the water much like you would in normal breast stroke then quickly shoot your hands back out in front of you.

\-Glide 3 = Normal breast stroke form, but before starting your next stroke allow your body to glide for 3 seconds (1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 on thousand not 1, 2, 3)

\-Stone Skipper = Just like body dolphin w/ scull, but on the 3rd Y, catch and pull the water much like you would in normal butterfly, but when your arms form a diamond under you stop moving your arms. This is your anchor point. Allow your body to almost tumble over your arms with your hands finishing back by your hips. To recover, brings your hands up and under you, keeping them tight to your body till they are straight out in front again.

\-Flutter Fly = As simple as it sounds, flutter kick with butterfly arms.

\-IMO = Individual Medley Order (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle)

So far the only ""goals"" I can find is tracking my time on specific lengths / swim styles, for example 1km crawl, or 300m crawl. I also try and up my endurance, by doing 2500m sessions (started with 1000m so big progress !).

[As I posted earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/gyw8dp/its_official_i_can_no_longer_swim/), I was scheduled for shoulder reconstruction this month.  The surgery was required due to some early trauma and dislocations when I was younger which was complicated by years of swimming.  The initial trauma caused the labrum to tear and heal open.  As long as I was still active I could maintain enough muscle mass to keep things fairly tight, but the open labrum would cause sublocations (minor dislocations) from time to time.  As time went on, I eventually suffered a rotator cuff tear that made the whole process snowball from there.  I was originally hoping to do the surgery over spring break, but COVID complications forced me to push it out to the week of July 4th.  Ironically, the Medical Center was in worse shape in July than it was in March, but we managed to get things done nonetheless.

The surgery was done with four endoscopic insertions under general anesthesia with a complete nerve block to median, radial and ulnar nerves.  The MRI and surgical images showed that I had damage to my socket, labrum and rotator cuff as expected,  To repair the labrum, they cut way the scar tissue, agitated the bone and fresh tendon, then stapled to labrum into the bone to force the labrum to heal closed as opposed to open.  The damage to the rotator cuff was minor and corrected by simple shaving away the damaged tissue, without need for a full rotator cuff corrective surgery.  This is fortunate since rotator cuff corrections are difficult and painful.  The damage to the socket was also minor given the amount of damage my labrum had suffered.  There was no need for either a ball or socket replacement which would also have been a much more problematic surgery.

For the first 2 days after surgery I had no feeling in my arm at all.  By the third day the feeling had returned but the shock to the arm pretty much made it completely immobile.  As of today I'm pretty much pain free though I'm under strict orders to keep my arm in this 5 point harness for at least 23 hours a day throughout July.  The only exception, amazingly, is minor finger work if I can rest my palm with my arm bent 90%.  So yes, I get to type again.  So I used this new found freedom to pen this post.  Since my shoulder had been slowly dying over the last 10 years, I would hardly even characterize my current condition as problematic.  If anything it feels better at this very moment than it did 2 weeks ago, while at rest, before my surgery.

The surgeons characterized the surgery as very successful and they feel the problems that were addressed should provide much better shoulder strength and stability than I've had for the last 20 years.  I'll be slinged for the next 3 weeks, then slowly be allowed greater range of motion.  They expect that I should be able to get back into the water by Christmas.  No surprises were found and none are expected.

,Swimming,"So I started my lessons with a swim trainer, he says I def have my basics down but my form is all off. So he told me to focus on over-rotating (for now only) so I can get used to the roll of the hips, and also focus on keeping my arms straight so I can glide more rather than taking more strokes.

I guess my question for this week is to ask for any tips on how to slow my breathing down so I don't jack up my heart rate and need to take breaths every 2 strokes? I want to be able to stay under for four strokes.

I don't want to focus on fixing too much things in  a session, so for now I'm focusing on the rotation and catch up drills. But I do want to add how to fix my side breathing or at least slow it down...

Notes for this set:

\-Strong Hold Time = Faster than moderate, but slower than fast. Try and maintain the pace you start with throughout the set.

\-DPS (Distance Per Stroke) = Maximize the distance traveled for each stroke while minimizing the total number of strokes to complete the set

\-Build = Start slow then get faster within the given distance

some info about me: i am a 20M 1.75 70Kg so average maybe on the skiny side i have been swimming from a very early age so i don't feel inconfortable around water but i have a reallly low indurence i had some heart problems when i was very young but not now and i wasn't the moste athletic in school.

so today i went for my first swim after 2 years with a friend a nice beach with a lot of waves(like we wanted).

so we swim for a bit and pause and swim again (i think you got what i mean) and then my freind tell me to try to go depper i said i am not really that good at floating but he tells me it will be easy.

so we start breaststroking(not the best technique but gets the job done) after like 2/3 min i can't go anymore my joints hurt me mainly my shoulders so we stop and float for around 5 min to catch our breath, the only problem is that i get exhausted more more trying to float my freind tells me to calm down and try another technique but i just get more exhausted(unlike him he is chilling) and try to get back, half way the waves starts to breack on the beach so there is a back and forth motion i try to strock when the water is pushing me but i feel like it's not working and i am just stroking in my place or even going depper so i try to stay calm but i am so exhausted i just want to let myself drown so i start panicing (not like in the movies just stroking very badly) so i get moooore exhausted my freinds take me from my hand and pushes me for like 25sec i am so exhausted i can't even help him i just try to push with my legs but i am sure it didn't really help so i we go out and he tells me that i just panic'd while floating buy trying the techinques and we continue our day.

what do you guys think, any help will be good and some floating/swimming and breathing technics if possible.

,Swimming,"So, I am a Masters swimmer from Spain. I taught myself to swim late in life (40+), and then joined a local club. Nice people, great coaches (seems to be a common feature in most swimming clubs I now know). I managed to improve my times, and even competed regularly in local Masters meets and in open water, but I was never really in the same league as some of my swim buddies, who were so much better and faster than me.

Then came Covid, and we were put under a strict lockdown and trainings and meets were cancelled. I never stopped exercising at home, though, mostly calisthenics and yoga, which I am still learning.

Three weeks ago we resumed our trainings, with a limited number of swimmers per lane, safety measures, etc. The thing is, I now feel *sloooow* and as graceful in the water as a brick. For scheduling reasons I am currently swimming with people who are much younger than me (15-18 years old) and who are part of the official competition team from my club. There are also a few thriatletes who are extremely fit and fast, closer to my age (I am almost 49) but still younger than me.

,Swimming,"Hello everyone,

I've been swimming steadily for a year now and after a winter of not taking care of my diet I've gained back 9kg (for info April 2019 155kg, July 2019 132kg, April 2020 141kg, July 2020 123kg). Since April I'm fully focused on this weight loss. I've set up my diet more reasonably and even though I have a hard time getting rid of alcohol consumption with friends on Saturday night, I have a healthy lifestyle (beside my obesity obviously). I won't stop until I reach 100kg and then I will see how much fat I have left so still a long way to go.

During quarantine (since March 17 in France) I've been walking everyday for about 45min. Since then I've been walking everyday for an hour except for the day that I swim.

It's been 3weeks since my pool reopened and now all pools in my area are open. I am currently swimming on Monday and Thursday but because opening hours were cut, I am only able to swim for about 45min (I can't leave my work to early as I have meeting everyday).

Now with all the pools reopening in my area I can have this program:

Monday 45min 25m pool

Tuesday as much as I want (opening hours are 18h-21h) in 25m pool

Wednesday walking/runninng for an hour in the woods

Thursday 45min in 25m pool 

Friday as much as I want (opening hours are 18h-21h)

Saturday morning as much as I want (opening hours are 9h30- 12h30)

Sunday walking/running for an hour in the woods

I'm looking to improve my speed because I have a hard time swimming below 20min/km for 2 or 3km. So I am asking you, what days should i go swimming ?  I am thinking of doing Monday Tuesday Thursday and Saturday.

During those training, apart from swimming without stopping for 200m - 400m or 1000m I don't introduce exercices. I am on mobile so surely I didn't look well enough but I didn't find detailed practices here (and surely I won't be able to have the same intensity or do the same thing on Monday and Tuesday).

I have my own equipment (Finns, paddles , board and even rubber bands).

As the gym in my area is doing discounts right now I'm thinking of adding some weight training with it.

I am on mobile so surely I didn&amp;#39;t look well enough but I didn&amp;#39;t find detailed practices here (and surely I won&amp;#39;t be able to have the same intensity or do the same thing on Monday and Tuesday).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have my own equipment (Finns, paddles , board and even rubber bands).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the gym in my area is doing discounts right now I&amp;#39;m thinking of adding some weight training with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for the advice (or pointing me to the right source if already detailed in this site) and if my post breaks any rules I apologise in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"Hi guys, this is my first post here.

I have been practicing BJJ (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) for 8 years at a good level (I am currently 24) and I was considering adding a couple of sessions of swimming to improve my overall conditioning. 
For those who don't know BJJ, it is a grappling sport done both with and without a kimono, performed at a generally lower intensity than judo or freestyle wrestling. 

I did either swimming and water polo until I was 14 years old so I was a decent swimmer, but I went to a swimming pool maybe twice in the past ten years, so I am not sure how my experience can be useful, especially on the conditioning side. 

I was wondering if someone could suggest me a training schedule or some general tips to get used to swimming again, and once I am at an acceptable level, to complement my main sport.

For those that would like some variation and/or a more structured workout, I provide for you our groups workout from today. Our workouts are split into 5 different skill levels. Choose the column that works best for you and if you find that you are consistently getting more rest than column 5, move up a level. Because this is Masters, feel free to add/subtract/or modify in anyway you see fit. 

Here is a link to my google drive with previous workouts - [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tHrMzBZWcVHQcs03vZX8rNQ73mdyR1j7?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tHrMzBZWcVHQcs03vZX8rNQ73mdyR1j7?usp=sharing)

If you are interested in joining a masters swim club, here is a link to help you find a local club near you. [https://www.usms.org/clubs](https://www.usms.org/clubs)

Notes for this set:

\-DPS (Distance Per Stroke) = Maximize the distance traveled for each stroke while minimizing the total number of strokes to complete the set

\-Rotate a Fast 25 = #1 25 FAST/75 Moderate, #2 25 Moderate/25 FAST/50 Moderate, #3 50 Moderate/25 FAST/25 Moderate, #4 75 Moderate/25 FAST

\-Build = Start slow then get faster within the given distance

\-Ascend = Maintain a given pace within the distance, but get **slower** as you work through the set (ascend in time/pace)

&lt;p&gt;Notes for this set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-DPS (Distance Per Stroke) = Maximize the distance traveled for each stroke while minimizing the total number of strokes to complete the set&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Rotate a Fast 25 = #1 25 FAST/75 Moderate, #2 25 Moderate/25 FAST/50 Moderate, #3 50 Moderate/25 FAST/25 Moderate, #4 75 Moderate/25 FAST&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Build = Start slow then get faster within the given distance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Ascend = Maintain a given pace within the distance, but get &lt;strong&gt;slower&lt;/strong&gt; as you work through the set (ascend in time/pace)&lt;/p&gt;

Today I swam 1.5 km with only two short 20 second breaks in 31 minutes. And I felt good afterwards. I could have kept going but our pool sessions last for 45 minutes to allow 15 minutes of cleaning before the next group.

But I can't seem to regulate my pace. I can either go fast and take a lot of breaks or slow with no breaks. I started counting my sprints and incorporating how many I do in a session and change stroke if I need a breather. .

&lt;p&gt;It has recently reopened and I started going regularly. My last swim was 1.5 km in 45 minutes. I took a few breaks and my shoulders were sore after not working them out for 3 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I swam 1.5 km with only two short 20 second breaks in 31 minutes. And I felt good afterwards. I could have kept going but our pool sessions last for 45 minutes to allow 15 minutes of cleaning before the next group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t seem to regulate my pace. I can either go fast and take a lot of breaks or slow with no breaks. I started counting my sprints and incorporating how many I do in a session and change stroke if I need a breather. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t like watching the clock if you understand?&lt;/p&gt;

3 years ago I was at a public pool with my father. I didn't know how to swim because my mother was always against it and she kinda forced me to have a fear of water because I could drown? Back then I had 15 years. My father was swimming and I was in the middle of the pool for some reason, just standing there. He accidentally touched me and I lost my balance and feel down, my head was at the bottom and legs on top. He literally pulled me a few seconds after, but from that moment I even shower with fear. Those few seconds seemed like they lasted forever. Last year I decided to go to classes and.. yeah. I couldn't even float without those floating stuff. I guess it was because I was not relaxed at all. But I couldn't relax, even when the instructor was literally holding me for legs and pushing.

,Swimming,"For context I am an 18 year old male 174 lbs 6'0"" \~14% bodyfat. I have always been negatively buoyant as far as I can remember. My goal right now is to train to a point in which I can easily pass all water testing in the pipeline to becoming an Airforce SOF PJ (Pararescue) operator. And I have heard that treading without hands is somewhere in the water tests-no specifics, so I'm trying to get a complete handle on that because it is seemingly my weakest area in the entire skill of swimming.

To begin, I think I'm doing the eggbeater correctly but from my results I just can't tell, it just seems ridiculously inefficient for me, I can coordinate it well and tread for a bit along with aid from my hands and I can see that with some practice and conditioning I might be able to make it close to as efficient as flutter kicks, but using it solely to tread without using my hands or god forbid- holding them out of the water?? I don't think it's possible... I'm generally a quick learner but I couldn't hold my head and hands above water for more than a few seconds after nearly 6 hours practicing in my pool yesterday while pumping my legs as hard and fast as I possibly could (Squat PR is 325 just so you know I don't skip leg day). And I don't mean I run out of power, I just sink while pumping away. I've tried with lungs full of air and it's not sustainable for more than a few seconds too.

Some extra information is that I tried everything with a full body wetsuit too and 1. I still couldn't float without lungs full, and 2. It barely helped with the eggbeater tread. Another tidbit is that I can tread without hands with the flutter kick for maybe a minute if I am completely fresh but it is absolutely the most draining thing I have ever done and my hamstrings cramp up by the end, so not really sustainable either.

Maybe I just need to keep at it but I've never gotten literally nowhere from so much effort in my life, and it's extremely discouraging and making me doubtful that I am doing anything in the water correctly because I can't see how none of my strength and endurance from running and lifting transfers over at least a little bit... I just feel like there has to be a better way or something I'm doing wrong, the only alternative is that I would have to get fatter to become buoyant... Which I strongly dislike the idea of but am not entirely opposed to if it means I can accomplish my goals.

I am a novice swimmer, I took some lessons so far, before that I was a total non-swimmer scared of water. Now I can swim front crawl and backstroke good enough to swim in a pool safely and comfortably.

It is probably because in a pool I can clearly see the bottom and surroundings so I feel I can control what I do and I feel safe while for example in a lake I cannot see anything (even when using googles) because the water is dirty and the moment my eyes are underwater then I become disoriented, I feel I'm about to drown and I panic instantly.

,Swimming,"Background: I've never swam competitively, I've finished an Ironman so I have some background and when I'm in shape I can swim about 2:00/100m. But I'm still jealous of the swimmer that seem to slice through the water with 20 second 25s at cruising pace. 

My pool is now open in limited sessions and I've been using fins and snorkel to work on freestyle technique. Then I take the snorkel off to work on breathing.

I've been working on the following, and any tips are appreciated. Obviously the first tip is to swim more, add volume.

* Keeping the ankles together, not spreading the legs. Fins help with this.
* Tightening my abs seems to help keep the hips at water surface level. I've always heard keep your hips up but never knew what body mechanics to use...I think this is it.
* Rotating along the body axis as I recover the arm.
* Putting the hand in first and extending like I'm putting my arm into a tube in front of my shoulder. 
* Nearly completing my opposite arm recovery before the catch.
* During the catch, I've been bringing my forearm perpendicular to the pool floor, and pulling more with my lats than my shoulders. It's kind of like using an oar. 
* When I complete the catch I try to touch my hip to complete it.
* I noticed something recently with my breathing, I may be turning my head too early...I think I have my mouth exposed well before the recovery is complete.

Also, my muscles were all tight from holding the baby and also not doing any exercise for 3 months.

The first 100m were easy (always is) and then everything after that was done with my arms feeling like lead.

I lasted the whole session though, fit into my pre pregnancy bathers and also enjoyed the social aspect of swimming.

Notes for this set:

\-The original copy of this workout had the intervals a little to fast for most members of the team. The 75's were especially tight with most of us either touch and go or missing the interval all together. I added 5-10 seconds to some of the sets but they still might be tight. Try your usual column but if you find that the intervals are still too tight move up a column or add another :05 to the interval

,Swimming,"I'm a paramedic.

Last night, on duty, we were called to a local gym and indoor pool facility for a teenager found drowned in the pool.

He was alone. Nobody knew how long he'd been under. Some gym goers walking by noticed he was just floating under the water and grabbed him out. 

They did CPR, and thankfully, by the time I got there, he was wide awake but in a lot of pain. 

He admitted to me later that he was trying to swim long lengths underwater and his last memory was trying to come up for air and then nothing. 

He experienced a shallow water blackout. Essentially, when you are trying to do long distances underwater, you can hyperventilate to maximize your oxygen intake and blow off much of your CO2, thus reducing the feeling of 'i need to surface for air' during your laps. 

But what ends up happening sometimes, is that you overdo it, and you end up expelling too much CO2. Then, as you are doing your lap, your brain becomes oxygen deprived, but the CO2 level in your body is too low for your brain to signal you to breath. 

And, without any warning, lights go out. No slow fade into darkness, no slow feeling of passing out. No, you pretty much just go out in a matter of seconds.

...

At the hospital, my patient's father expressed shock to me that this happened to his kid. His kid is an incredible competitive swimmer, one of the best in his age group. It didn't make sense that he nearly drowned. He could understand some rookie, but his kid? In a pool that was maybe 5 feet deep? 

I told him yes, his kid, in a shallow pool, surrounded by other people. He almost lost his life before he even started it in earnest.

,Swimming,"Recently I had signed up for my schools swim team without ever having done competitive swim ever, I cant even dive properly. But because of how small the team is I dont have to do any try outs. After buying swim jammers and trying them on I've been extremely nervous about how I look and how dumb I'm going to look learning how to swim.

,Swimming,"So I just got out of practice and I need to vent. After an hour of dry land, we hopped in the pool and did ours warmup. We did a long pre set, and moved on. For the first part of our main set, our coach had us do a 500 kick followed by a 1,000 freestyle swim. Nasty stuff especially bc I’m a sprinter. Im a 100 into this kick when I see a kid I havnt seen come into practice for a while. He sneaks down the stairs, puts down his bag, and dives into the pool “stealthily.” This guy does a 50 and then grabs my leg in the water while I’m going the opposite way. He asks me what set we are doing, and tells me that he skipped the first 60% of practice bc he didn’t feel like going. 

I roll my eyes, tell him the set, and start swimming. This happened quickly so I wasn’t even a 300 into the kick when he drops his kickboard and starts the freestyle. Coach yells, “hey, ____ did you do the kick?” “Ya coach I just lapped everyone else.”  Whatever, not my business, just keep swimming. He is going faster than me know because he is swimming and I am kicking. He swims up behind me. Now, it’s been different at other places I swam, but for the most part I think that when you want to pass someone, you tap them on the leg. This kid grabs my leg, yanks it backwards, puts his other arm on my shoulder, and pulls himself foreword over me. Then, he kicks me in the chin (prob by accident but still) and swims off. Not even an “oops.” I’m fuming, and ready to yell at him. I continue doing my kick, and he comes up behind me one more time. 

And I couldn’t believe it, but he did it again! Not sure if I’m describing it great but if it was on land it would be considered a tackle. I stood up in the water, grabbed his legs, and said “hey jackass, don’t do that again” which is really uncharacteristic for me bc I usually don’t curse unless I’m very close to the person. And damn the audacity of this bitch. He looks me straight in the eye and says “Hey man, don’t hate just because I’m faster.” Iv never wanted to slap a guy more then I did right than.

,Swimming,"Hey, very new to this reddit. I’m having a bit of confusion with regards to pool etiquette etc. 
I have recently started swimming again, mainly in the evenings but now due to work I try and swim during the day.

It wasn’t a MASSIVE problem before and I have only ever got frustrated a couple of times. 

But today I got so frustrated I had to leave the pool completely and went for a run. 

So because I have switched to day time swimming there are a lot more mums (like me) but I would call them the ‘social swimmers’; mainly swimming in breast stroke two abreast having conversations with their heads completely out of the water practically “swimming” vertically. A few are the older ladies but ya know if you’re slow, you are slow and I will wait a reasonable distance till I set off from the side of the pool. 

Then there are the REALLY fast swimmers. Mainly men and a couple of very athletic ladies. However due to their only being three lanes (two fast and one slow) the majority of people are in the slow lane so today I was swimming in a slow lane with about 9 people. 

My question is: as I am still relatively slow (not slow slow) and I am swimming for fitness and training should I try and get into the fast lane? Or should I just go back to trying to swim in the evenings when pools are quieter? 

I’m really struggling because I’m so “inbetween” the paces. I’m not slow and I’m not as fast as others. 
Is it worth pushing myself to my limits just so I don’t frustrate slower and faster swimmers by being in the wrong lanes?",t2_7ruhyy4k,False,,0,False,Too fast for the slow lane....too slow for the fast lane,[],r/Swimming,False,6,etiquette,0,,,False,t3_io8fs0,False,dark,0.99,,public,180,1,{},,63022e8a-6c35-11e9-b01d-0acf30770a48,False,[],,False,False,,{},Pool Etiquette,False,180,,False,self,False,default,[],{},,True,,1599517880.0,text,6,,,text,self.Swimming,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, very new to this reddit.

,Swimming,"Hey Swimming Reddit,

I wanted to make a quick post to celebrate that I'm up to swimming 1200m in 30 mins! It's certainly not fast for those of you who have trained but I'm so proud of myself. I swam competitively when I was 10 for a year and that's the only training I've had. I'm now nearly 30 (yikes) and only really getting back into swimming. About 2 years ago, I tried to swim again, and was struggling to hit 600m in an hour. So feeling accomplished and I don't have anyone to share it with. 

Recently, I took up freediving and love the feeling of powering through the water with my fins. It just feels right. I'm excited to get my swimming up to speed (maybe not fin speed though) and the endurance for swimming and diving.

I'm very fortunate - I have a gorgeous Olympic-sized open-air pool less than 10 m from my office that is completely free for me to swim in and I shall be making the most of it. Today we had a torrential downpour and it was very soul-soothing to swim amongst the raindrops.

,Swimming,"Hello Reddit! 

I am a high school JV athlete and I want to train on my own in anticipation of varsity tryouts this year. It's my senior year, and so its really important to me that I make it this year.

I talked to my coach, and here are the 2 criteria for making the team:

1. Complete 10 x 100 yards on a 1:30 interval (don't miss any intervals)
2. develop a general endurance to get through a 2-4000 yard 90-minute intense varsity practice

Unfortunately, where I live, I cannot join my local swim club due to COVID restraints. 

As a result, I must go out on my own to force my self to workout out to make tryouts. 

My motivation is pretty good, and my tolerance for working out is moderately high, but I definitely don't have any remarkable ability to swim crazy workouts. Especially right now as I am out of shape.

I have done some work, and here is the kind of workouts I have completed: 

* 100 warmup
* 10 x 100 on the 1:55 
* cooldown
* \*\*felts pretty easy going. \~70% difficulty

My past PRs:

50: 26 low

100: \~103

500: 7:16

(all freestyle)

I hope this gives enough information. **Can you please advise me on how to think about planning my workouts and maybe point me in the direction of a workout plan?**

Constraints: 

1. I would like to be in the water for 30-60 minutes give or take
2. I do not have many extra pieces of equipment. Only a cap and goggles.

\- When sharing a lane - do you kick off at the end of the land or do a turnaround? (I just find those flip kick offs like something fun to do, but don't want to annoy anyone)

,Swimming,"Ok, so first of all thanks for the information I got from the previous post, which was really helpful. 

Now, I basically try to swim to burn off fat every day (with moderate success). However! It wasn't until recently that I realized how much I actually suck at this (a year or so of experience, half a dozen training sessions with a coach). 

All my life I've been swimming without much effort so I'm used to more or less doing a few laps at a medium pace and then going back to slow. And just last week I remembered something my friend said who swims for the state: ""What you're doing isn't swimming. I'm ""swimming"" swimming"". My grandfather could do what you're doing."" So at the time, I didn't pay much attention thinking she was just teasing me. And the last time at the lake it was sort of like pieces of a puzzle came together and I tried imagining I'm a competitive swimmer and really giving it my everything. 

10 minutes and 2 collapsed lungs later (joking, no animals were harmed during the making of this), staggering home, I was thinking this was the best and the worst day of my life ever. That time I really felt like I've achieved something. I actually felt like I was building muscle too, plus the next day, looking in the mirror I was like - whoa. The upper part of my body actually got bigger (not a lot, but the changes were quantifiable) and I literally lost a little weight overnight. Which was hugely motivating. So I'm gonna keep it up. 

The problem here is that for some reason swimming really takes it out of me. Maybe I'm just really unfit but as soon as I finish training even as I'm walking home I feel exhausted but not just on a physical level. My motivation goes down, and it's really hard to get out of bed the next morning. And that was the lazy way!

That day when I went Sonic for the next two days I was **really** tired. It was just awful. I don't know how you people do it. The worst part is that morale kind of drops, and doing everything is harder. 

Any recommendations on how to recover better? Like literally anything. Good food and mediation help. Maybe I should take a couple of hours every day and just read a book in bed instead of running around like a lunatic doing stuff all the time. 

Anyway, any advice will be appreciated.

My grandfather could do what you&amp;#39;re doing.&amp;quot; So at the time, I didn&amp;#39;t pay much attention thinking she was just teasing me. And the last time at the lake it was sort of like pieces of a puzzle came together and I tried imagining I&amp;#39;m a competitive swimmer and really giving it my everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 minutes and 2 collapsed lungs later (joking, no animals were harmed during the making of this), staggering home, I was thinking this was the best and the worst day of my life ever. That time I really felt like I&amp;#39;ve achieved something. I actually felt like I was building muscle too, plus the next day, looking in the mirror I was like - whoa. The upper part of my body actually got bigger (not a lot, but the changes were quantifiable) and I literally lost a little weight overnight. Which was hugely motivating. So I&amp;#39;m gonna keep it up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that for some reason swimming really takes it out of me. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just really unfit but as soon as I finish training even as I&amp;#39;m walking home I feel exhausted but not just on a physical level. My motivation goes down, and it&amp;#39;s really hard to get out of bed the next morning. And that was the lazy way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That day when I went Sonic for the next two days I was &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; tired. It was just awful. I don&amp;#39;t know how you people do it. The worst part is that morale kind of drops, and doing everything is harder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any recommendations on how to recover better? Like literally anything. Good food and mediation help. Maybe I should take a couple of hours every day and just read a book in bed instead of running around like a lunatic doing stuff all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, any advice will be appreciated. Ciao!&lt;/p&gt;

,Swimming,"I was always a side breather in butterfly. I would breathe and keep one goggle in the water exactly like in freestyle. People were always amazed at how low I breathed. My breathing was so low people would ask me ""why didn't you breathe?"" I was the only person I'd met that breathed like that. I know other people do it too, but I never met or saw anyone that did it. I always felt that I was able to have a longer and more relaxed breath than anyone else. Sometimes I would even leave my head to the side and breathe every stroke without any effort. The natural rise in butterfly would give me enough lift to open my mouth to breathe.  

&amp;#x200B;

I took a long break from swimming and found that I can't do it as well anymore. I've been breathing to the front and have found it easier than attempting to breathe to the side. But I'm a little confused as to when exactly to breathe. I've been experimenting with the timing of my breath. I've tried lifting my chin right before the start of my pull, and the rise from my undulation gets my head just high enough to breathe. I've also experimented with lifting my chin during my second kick to breathe during the downbeat of my kick.

&amp;#x200B;

Butterfly has always been my best stroke/event. I think it's because I could have a very fast tempo because I could just keep my head to the side and not move my head until it was time for a turn. I've found it harder to pick up my tempo with the change of my breathing style. So I'm still practicing breathing to the side but want to perfect my front breathing. Which way is correct? During what phase of my pull and kick should I be breathing when breathing to the front?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an experienced swimmer, and butterfly is by far my fastest stroke. My technique is still pretty good. I know how to swim butterfly properly, but this change in breathing is challenging me. I want to swim a USMS meet when things return to a relative state of normalcy.

,Swimming,"I've been lap swimming extremely casually for about two years after teaching myself to swim. My swimming before that would be what I would consider 'not drowning.' It's taken a long time, but I am finally starting to feel comfortable in the water and would like to get more serious about my swimming. 

My first question is there a good two-piece swim suit that is good for women? I don't feel comfortable with the one-piece styles that don't have some kind of shorts. I've seen posts about jammers. Do they make those for women?

Second, is there a good strategy for practicing flip turns? I did them for about a month about a year ago but every time I did, I would have to hold my nose to do the turns or just have a ton of water forced up my nose. 

Finally, is there like a pre-prescribed go to pre or post-workout food that I should have? I played soccer in high school and my coach was constantly reminding us to eat bananas, so I was wondering if the same strategy applied to swimming. I feel like I never workout at the pool at a consistent time, just whenever I can fit it into my work schedule.

&lt;p&gt;I just missed the feeling of competing thus gonna try to regain back my strength and if ever I get to compete here in the states it would be my first here and would be one check off my bucket list : )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other advice such as training etc would be appreciated! : )&lt;/p&gt;
